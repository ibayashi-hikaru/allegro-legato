Here one may find simple examples showing how "fix wall/ess" and "fix wall/region/ess" work. 


--in.fix_wall_region:
	
	This input uses "Data_region" to setup a system of three particles colliding with a
	cubic region which its walls interact with particle with EES potential. To find out details
	of how to set parameters of "fix wall/region/ees" see documentation.

--in.fix_wall
	
	This input uses "Data_wall" to confine a ellipsoidal particle between two EES walls.
	For more details lookup LAMMPS's documentation under "fix wall/ess" command.
