The input script in.lammps simulates bulk water using the 2015 E3B potential.

This script also demonstrates the use of compute pair to calculate the
potential energy contribution of the e3b pair style. These potential energy
contributions can be found in the output file e3b.txt. See the LAMMPS
documentation for more details.
