Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics examples

equipartition-verification:
  This example verifies the equipartition theorem.
  It simulates a periodic box of water with no solid bodies.
  If equipartition theorem holds true, the average of each component of
  translational kinetic energy should be equal to k_B T, and therefore
  vx_sq_check, vy_sq_check, and vz_sq_check should fluctuate near 1.

2d-diffusion:
  This example demonstrates the free diffusion of a disk in 2D.
  The 3D simulation is similar but takes much longer to complete.
  As with other statistical experiments you need an ensemble to
  extract meaningful average quantities.
  For a more realistic simulation you should increase the resolution
  of the disk/sphere which also necessitates reduction of timestep.

2d-diffusion-in-shear-flow:
  This example demonstrates the diffusion of a disk in shear flow in 2D.
  The 3D simulation is similar but takes much longer to complete.
  As with other statistical experiments you need an ensemble to
  extract meaningful average quantities.
  For a more realistic simulation you should increase the resolution
  of the disk/sphere which also necessitates reduction of timestep.
