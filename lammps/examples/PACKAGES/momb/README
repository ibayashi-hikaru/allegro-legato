pair_style momb example
=================

This folder contains a example of the use of pair_style momb for system
containing Ag, ethylene glycol (EG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).
The pair_style is designed for the interaction between metals and organic
compounds. For this Ag-EG-PVP system, we use pair_style momb for the
interaction between Ag and the oxygen atom in EG and PVP, as described in
the publication listed below.

Other potentials used for this Ag-EG-PVP system includes the
EAM, Morse, and CHARMM potential. We note that the EAM potential file,
'Ag_O1X5.5_O2X0.55.eam.fs', also contains the information about the
one-way electron density donation from the oxygen atoms to Ag atoms.
