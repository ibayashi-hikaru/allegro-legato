The example input script sets up a simple FCC crystal using the Lennard-Jones
potential. The script sets up the HMA compute to calculate the energy, pressure
and heat capacity.  The output columns are:

1: timestep
2: measured temperature
3: potential energy
4: HMA potential energy
5: pressure
6: HMA pressure
7: HMA heat capacity contribution

Averages of the potential energy (#3 and #4) agree although #4 (HMA) is more precise.

Averages of the pressure (#5 and #6) agree once the ideal gas
contribution is included; #6 (HMA) is more precise.

The heat capacity can be computed from colume #3 (conventional) as
Cv = Var(#3)/(k T^2)

With HMA, the heat capacity can be computed from column #4 and #7 as
Cv = #7 + Var(#4)/(k T^2)
