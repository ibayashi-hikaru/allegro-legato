# System of 2 pairs of rigid particles moving towards one another.          #
# At each timestep, the hydrodynamic force acting on one of these four      #
# rigid particles is printed to the screen.                                 #
#                                                                           #
# Here, gamma (used in the calculation of the particle-fluid interaction    #
#   force) is set by the user (gamma = 3.303 for this simulation...this     #
#   value has been calibrated a priori through simulations of the drag      #
#   force acting on a single particle of the same radius).                  # 
#                                                                           #
