This dir contains scripts that demonstrate how to use LAMMPS as an
MDI engine.  LAMMPS as an engine performs the MD timestepping.
The driver is a simple Python script.  Every timestep the driver
sends one or more commands to LAMMPS.

--------------

The Script.sh file has comands to perform some very simple example
runs.

--------------

More complex calculations using LAMMPS as an MDI engine will
typically require the use of an MDI driver.  Several MDI drivers
support calculations with LAMMPS, and include:

Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) Driver:
