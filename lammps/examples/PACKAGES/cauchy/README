Run this example by executing:

% lmp -in in.cauchystat

Note that this example use an EAM potential, and therefore must be
run with a LAMMPS executable built with the MANYBODY package.

The first cauchystat fix equilibrates the temperature at zero stress,
the second fix applies a shear stress. Output in avg.txt shows
convergence to correct values.
