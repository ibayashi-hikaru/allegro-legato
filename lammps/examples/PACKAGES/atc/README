This directory contains examples run using the AtC library in LAMMPS
in its various coupling and post-processing modes.  Descriptions of
the files in each are provided below. In addition to the included
output these examples will "dump" mesh-based data either in binary
(Ensight) format or simple column-based text format (for gnuplot, for
example).
