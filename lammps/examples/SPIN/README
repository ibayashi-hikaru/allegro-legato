This directory contains examples and applications of the SPIN package
=====================================================================

- the benchmark directory provides comparison between LAMMPS
  results and a series of simple test problems (coded as python
  scripts).

- the iron, cobalt_hcp, cobalt_fcc and nickel directories provide 
  examples of spin-lattice calculations.

- the bfo repository provides an example of spin dynamics calculation
  performed on a fixed lattice, and applied to the multiferroic 
  material bismuth-oxide. 

- the read_restart directory provides examples allowing to write or 
  read data files, and restart magneto-mechanical simulations.  

- vizualization of the dump files can be achieved using Ovito or 
  VMD. See the vmd repository for help vizualizing results with VMD. 

** Note, the aim of this repository is mainly to provide users with
examples. Better values and tuning of the magnetic and mechanical 
interactions can (have to...) be achieved for more accurate materials 
simulations. **
