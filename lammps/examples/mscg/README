Running this example requires that LAMMPS be built with the MSCG
package and its fix mscg command.  The fix uses the Multi-Scale
Coarse-Graining (MS-CG) library, freely available at
https://github.com/uchicago-voth/MSCG-release, to compute optimized
coarse-grained force field parameters.  The MS-CG library was
developed by Jacob Wagner in Greg Voth's group at the University of
Chicago.

See the lib/mscg/README file for instructions on how to download and
install the MS-CG library for use with LAMMPS.
