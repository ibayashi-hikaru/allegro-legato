Running this example requires that LAMMPS be built with the VORONOI
package and its compute voronoi command.  The compute uses the Voro++
library, freely available at http://math.lbl.gov/voro++, to compute
the Voronoi tesselation locally on each processor.  Voro++ was
developed by Chris H. Rycroft while at UC Berkeley / Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory.

See the lib/voronoi/README file for instructions on how to download
and install the Voro++ library for use with LAMMPS.
