This directory contains Fortran code which interface LAMMPS as a library
and allows the LAMMPS library interface to be invoked from Fortran codes.
It requires a Fortran compiler that supports the Fortran 2003 standard.

This interface is based on and supersedes the previous Fortran interfaces
in the examples/COUPLE/fortran* folders.  But is fully supported by the
LAMMPS developers and included in the documentation and unit testing.

Details on this Fortran interface and how to build programs using it
are in the manual in the doc/html/pg_fortran.html file.
