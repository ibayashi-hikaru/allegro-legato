modified by an appropriate smoother for the smooth, Ewald, and PPPM 
styles.</P>

(2) lj/switch </H4>
<PRE>

    = spline fit    for  r_inner &lt; r &lt; cutoff
    = 0             for r &gt; cutoff

  switching function (spline fit) is applied to standard LJ
    within a switching region (from r_inner to cutoff) so that
    energy and force go smoothly to zero
  spline coefficients are computed by LAMMPS
    so that at inner cutoff (r_inner) the potential, force, 
    and 1st-derivative of force are all continuous, 
    and at outer cutoff (cutoff) the potential and force
    both go to zero

The coefficients for each nonbond style are input in either the data 
file by the &quot;read data&quot; command or in the input script using 
the &quot;nonbond coeff&quot; command. In the former case, only one set 
of coefficients is input for each atom type. The cross-type coeffs are 
computed using one of three possible mixing rules: </P>
<PRE>

 geometric:  epsilon_ij = sqrt(epsilon_i * epsilon_j)
             sigma_ij = sqrt(sigma_i * sigma_j)

 arithmetic: epsilon_ij = sqrt(epsilon_i * epsilon_j)
             sigma_ij = (sigma_i + sigma_j) / 2

 sixthpower: epsilon_ij =
               (2 * sqrt(epsilon_i*epsilon_j) * sigma_i^3 * sigma_j^3) /
               (sigma_i^6 + sigma_j^6)
             sigma_ij=  ((sigma_i**6 + sigma_j**6) / 2) ^ (1/6)

</PRE>
<P>
The default mixing rule for nonbond styles lj/cutoff, lj/switch, 
lj/shift, and soft is &quot;geometric&quot;. The default for nonbond 
style class2/cutoff is &quot;sixthpower&quot;. </P>
<P>
The default can be overridden using the &quot;mixing style&quot; 
command. The one exception to this is for the nonbond style soft, for 
which only an epsilon prefactor is input. This is always mixed 
geometrically. </P>
<P>
Also, for nonbond style lj/shift, the delta coefficient is always mixed 
using the rule </P>

  coeff1 = K (energy)
  coeff2 = d (always +1 or -1)
  coeff3 = n (1,2,3,4,6)

  Cautions when comparing to other force fields:

  some force fields reverse the sign convention on d so that
    E = K [1 - d * cos(n*phi)]
  some force fields divide/multiply K by the number of multiple
    torsions that contain the j-k bond in an i-j-k-l torsion
  some force fields let n be positive or negative which 
    corresponds to d = 1,-1
  in the LAMMPS force field, the trans position = 180 degrees, while
    in some force fields trans = 0 degrees

  in data file, listing of 4 atoms requires atom-1 as central atom
  some force fields (AMBER,Discover) have atom-2 as central atom - it is really
    an out-of-plane torsion, may need to treat as dihedral in LAMMPS
