LAMMPS Input Commands</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="README.html">Return</A> to top-level of LAMMPS documentation.</P>
<P>
This page contains a complete list of valid LAMMPS inputs. It will be 
easiest to understand if you read it while looking at sample input 
files such as those in the examples directory. </P>
<P>
The input file of commands is read by LAMMPS, one line at a time. Each 
command causes LAMMPS to take some action. Usually it simply causes 
some internal variable(s) to be set. Or it may cause a file to be read 
in or a simulation to be run. In general, commands can be listed in any 
order, although some commands require others to have been executed 
previously. </P>
<P>
LAMMPS continues to read successive lines from the input command file 
until the end-of-file is reached which causes LAMMPS to terminate. Thus 
new simulations can be run or current simulations continued by simply 
specifying additional commands in the input command file. </P>
<P>
The next section of this page gives an example of each command, some of 
which can be specified in multiple styles. Typically the commands take 
one or more parameters. The keyword for each command should begin in 
the leftmost column and all characters in the command and its 
parameters should be in lower-case. Parameters can be separated by 
arbitrary numbers of spaces and/or tabs (so long as the command fits on 
one line). The remainder of the line after the last parameter is 
ignored.</P>
<P>
The final section of this page gives a more detailed description of 
each command with its associated parameters. It also lists the default 
parameters associated with each command. When performing a simulation, 
you only need specify a particular command if you do not want to use 
the default settings.</P>

an atom can be assigned to multiple constraints, the constraints will be

if simulated system has no charges, must set &quot;coulomb style none&quot; to

accuracy criterion means &quot;one part in value&quot; - e.g. 1.0E-4
Ewald and PPPM accuracy criterion are used in conjunction with cutoff
  to partition work between short-range and long-range routines
accuracy criterion effectively determines how many k-space vectors are used
  to approximate the energy and forces
for PPPM, accuracy criterion determines mesh spacing (see &quot;particle mesh&quot;
  command)
for PPPM, must be running on power-of-2 number of processors for FFTs
must use periodic boundary conditions in conjunction with Ewald and PPPM
cannot use any styles other than none with nonbond style = lj/shift or
  nonbond style = soft
Coulomb style = smooth should be used with nonbond style = lj/switch,
  and both should use same inner and outer cutoffs
for smooth style, outer cutoff must be &gt; inner cutoff
for smooth style, atom pairs less than the inner cutoff distance use 
  usual Coulomb, pairs between inner and outer are smoothed, and the 
  potential goes to 0.0 at the outer cutoff
for smooth style, force is continuously differentiable everywhere

define a constraint
cannot skip a constraint number, all must be used before a run is performed

which atoms the constraint will affect is set by the &quot;assign fix&quot; command
all of the constraints (except for rescale) are applied every timestep
all specified temperatures are in temperature units
for style setforce, a coeff of NULL means do not alter that force component
for style aveforce, average force on the group of fixed atoms is computed,
  then new average force is added in and actual force on each atom is set
  to new total value -&gt; has effect of applying same force to entire group
  of atoms
thermostatting constraints (rescale, langevin, nose/hoover) cannot be used in
  conjunction with global &quot;temp control&quot;, since they conflict and will
  cause atom velocities to be reset twice
if multiple Langevin constraints are specified the Marsaglia RNG will
  only use the last RNG seed specified for initialization
meaning of thermostatting coefficients is same as in &quot;temp control&quot; command
style springforce is designed to be applied to an entire group of atoms
  en masse (e.g. an umbrella force on an entire molecule)
for style springforce, the center of mass r0 of the group of atoms is computed,
  then a restoring force = -k*(r-r0)*mass/masstotal is applied to each 
  atom in the group where mass = mass of the atom and masstotal = mass of
  all the atoms in the group - thus &quot;k&quot; should represent the total
  force on the group of atoms (not per atom)
for style springforce, a xyz position of NULL means do not include that
  dimension in the distance or force computation
for style dragforce, apply a drag force of magnitude f to each atom in the
  group in the direction (r-r0) where r0 = (x,y,z) - do not apply the force if
  the atom is within a distance delta of r0
for style dragforce, a xyz position of NULL means do not include that

define style of pairwise nonbond interactions to use between all atom types
use appropriate number of coeffs for a particular style
this is separate from charge interactions (see &quot;coulomb style&quot; command)
nonbond style determines how many nonbond coefficients the program expects to
  find in a &quot;Nonbond Coeffs&quot; entry in the data file or when using the 
  &quot;nonbond coeff&quot; command, thus the style must be set (if not using default)
  before using the &quot;read data&quot; command (if the data file contains a 
  &quot;Nonbond Coeffs&quot; entry)
coefficients for all atom type pairs must be defined in data (or restart)
  file by &quot;Nonbond Coeffs&quot; entry or by &quot;nonbond coeffs&quot; commands before a run
  is performed
style of &quot;none&quot; erases all previously defined nonbond coefficients, must
  reset style to something else before defining new coefficients
for all styles (except none), this command sets the cutoff(s) for all type
  pair interactions, thus overriding any previous settings by a &quot;nonbond
  coeff&quot; command or that were read in from a restart file
for lj/cutoff, lj/shift, class2/cutoff styles, 
  offset flag only affects printout of thermodynamic energy
  (not forces or dynamics), determines whether offset energy 
  is added in to LJ potential to make value at cutoff = 0.0,
  flag = 0 -&gt; do not add in offset energy,
  flag = 1 -&gt; add in offset energy 
for lj/smooth style, outer cutoff must be &gt; inner cutoff
for lj/smooth style, atom pairs less than the inner cutoff distance use 
  straight LJ, pairs between inner and outer use a smoothed LJ, and the 
  potential goes to 0.0 at the outer cutoff
for lj/smooth style, energy and forces are continuous at inner cutoff and go
  smoothly to zero at outer cutoff
for lj/shift and soft styles, must set &quot;coulomb style&quot; to &quot;none&quot;
for lj/shift style, delta shift distances for each atom pair are set by
  &quot;Nonbond Coeffs&quot; entry in data file or by &quot;nonbond coeffs&quot; command
for soft style, values of the prefactor &quot;A&quot;, which is ramped from one
