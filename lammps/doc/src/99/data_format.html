LAMMPS Data Format</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="README.html">Return</A> to top-level of LAMMPS documentation</P>
<P>
This file describes the format of the data file read into LAMMPS with 
the &quot;read data&quot; command. The data file contains basic 
information about the size of the problem to be run, the initial atomic 
coordinates, molecular topology, and (optionally) force-field 
coefficients. It will be easiest to understand this file if you read it 
while looking at a sample data file from the examples.</P>

<P>
Blank lines are important. After the header section, new entries are 
separated by blank lines. </P>
<P>
Indentation and space between words/numbers on one line is not 
important except that entry keywords (e.g. Masses, Bond Coeffs) must be 
left-justified and capitalized as shown. </P>
<P>
The header section (thru box bounds) must appear first in the file, the 
remaining entries (Masses, various Coeffs, Atoms, Bonds, etc) can come 
in any order. </P>
<P>
These entries must be in the file: header section, Masses, Atoms. </P>
<P>
These entries must be in the file if there are a non-zero number of 
them: Bonds, Angles, Dihedrals, Impropers, Bond Coeffs, Angle Coeffs, 
Dihedral Coeffs, Improper Coeffs. Cross-term coefficients for a 
particular kind of interaction (e.g. BondAngle Coeffs for bonds) must 
appear if class II force fields have been turned on in the input 
command file via a &quot;style&quot; command. </P>
<P>
The Nonbond Coeffs entry contains one line for each atom type. These 
are the coefficients for an interaction between 2 atoms of the same 
type. The cross-type coeffs are computed by the appropriate class I or 
class II mixing rules, or can be specified explicitly using the 
&quot;nonbond coeff&quot; command in the input command script. See the <A
 HREF="force_fields.html">force_fields</A> page for more information. </P>
<P>
The Nonbond Coeffs and Bond Coeffs entries are optional since they can 
be specified from the input command script. This is not true if bond 
style is set to class II since those coeffs can only be specified in 
this data file. </P>
<P>
In the Atoms entry, the atoms can be in any order so long as there are 
N entries. The 1st number on the line is the atom-tag (number from 1 to 
N) which is used to identify the atom throughout the simulation. The 
molecule-tag is a second identifier which is attached to the atom; it 
can be 0, or a counter for the molecule the atom is part of, or any 
other number you wish. The q value is the charge of the atom in 
electron units (e.g. +1 for a proton). The xyz values are the initial 
position of the atom. For 2-d simulations specify z as 0.0.</P>
<P>
The final 3 nx,ny,nz values on a line of the Atoms entry are optional. 
LAMMPS only reads them if the &quot;true flag&quot; command is 
specified in the input command script. Otherwise they are initialized 
to 0 by LAMMPS. Their meaning, for each dimension, is that 
&quot;n&quot; box-lengths are added to xyz to get the atom's 
&quot;true&quot; un-remapped position. This can be useful in pre- or 
post-processing to enable the unwrapping of long-chained molecules 
which wrap thru the periodic box one or more times. The value of 
&quot;n&quot; can be positive, negative, or zero. For 2-d simulations 
specify nz as 0. </P>
<P>
For simulations with periodic boundary conditions, xyz are remapped 
into the periodic box (from as far away as needed), so the initial 
coordinates need not be inside the box. The nx,ny,nz values (as read in 
or as set to zero by LAMMPS) are appropriately adjusted by this 
remapping. </P>
<P>
The number of coefficients specified on each line of coefficient 
entries (Nonbond Coeffs, Bond Coeffs, etc) depends on the 
&quot;style&quot; of interaction. This is specified in the input 
command script, unless the default is used. See the <A
 HREF="input_commands.html">input_commands</A> page for a description 
of the various style options. The <A HREF="input_commands.html">input_commands</A>
 and <A HREF="force_fields.html">force_fields</A> pages explain the 
meaning and valid ranges for each of the coefficients. </P>

important in this example.</P>
