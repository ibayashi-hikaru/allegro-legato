* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`fix <fix>` command
* lineforce = style name of this fix command
* x y z = direction of line as a 3-vector

Description
"""""""""""

Adjust the forces on each atom in the group so that only the component
of force along the linear direction specified by the vector (x,y,z)
remains.  This is done by subtracting out components of force in the
plane perpendicular to the line.

If the initial velocity of the atom is 0.0 (or along the line), then
it should continue to move along the line thereafter.

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.  None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.

The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization,
invoked by the :doc:`minimize <minimize>` command.
