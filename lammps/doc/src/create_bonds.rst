Description
"""""""""""

Create bonds between pairs of atoms that meet a specified distance
criteria.  Or create a single bond, angle, dihedral or improper between 2, 3,
or 4 specified atoms.

The new bond (angle, dihedral, improper) interactions will then be computed
during a simulation by the bond (angle, dihedral, improper) potential defined by
the :doc:`bond_style <bond_style>`, :doc:`bond_coeff <bond_coeff>`,
:doc:`angle_style <angle_style>`, :doc:`angle_coeff <angle_coeff>`,
:doc:`dihedral_style <dihedral_style>`,
:doc:`dihedral_coeff <dihedral_coeff>`, :doc:`improper_style <improper_style>`,
:doc:`improper_coeff <improper_coeff>` commands.

The *many* style is useful for adding bonds to a system, e.g. between
nearest neighbors in a lattice of atoms, without having to enumerate
all the bonds in the data file read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>`
command.

The *single* styles are useful for adding bonds, angles, dihedrals, impropers
to a system incrementally, then continuing a simulation.

Note that this command does not auto-create any angle, dihedral or improper
interactions when a bond is added.  Nor does it auto-create any bonds
when an angle, dihedral or improper is added.  Or auto-create any angles when a
dihedral or improper is added.  Thus the flexibility of this command is limited.
It can be used several times to create different types of bond at
different distances.  But it cannot typically auto-create all the
bonds or angles or dihedrals or impropers that would normally be defined in a
data file for a complex system of molecules.

.. note::

   If the system has no bonds (angles, dihedrals, impropers) to begin with,
   or if more bonds per atom are being added than currently exist, then you
   must insure that the number of bond types and the maximum number of
   bonds per atom are set to large enough values.  And similarly for
   angles, dihedrals and impropers.  Otherwise an error may occur when too many
   bonds (angles, dihedrals, impropers) are added to an atom.  If the
   :doc:`read_data <read_data>` command is used to define the system, these
   parameters can be set via the "bond types" and "extra bond per atom"
   fields in the header section of the data file.  If the
   :doc:`create_box <create_box>` command is used to define the system,
   these 2 parameters can be set via its optional "bond/types" and
   "extra/bond/per/atom" arguments.  And similarly for angles, dihedrals and
   impropers.  See the doc pages for these 2 commands for details.

----------

The *many* style will create bonds between pairs of atoms I,J where I
is in one of the two specified groups, and J is in the other.  The two
groups can be the same, e.g. group "all".  The created bonds will be
of bond type *btype*, where *btype* must be a value between 1 and the
number of bond types defined.

For a bond to be created, an I,J pair of atoms must be a distance D
apart such that *rmin* <= D <= *rmax*\ .

The following settings must have been made in an input script before
this style is used:

* special_bonds weight for 1-2 interactions must be 0.0
* a :doc:`pair_style <pair_style>` must be defined
* no :doc:`kspace_style <kspace_style>` defined
* minimum :doc:`pair_style <pair_style>` cutoff + :doc:`neighbor <neighbor>` skin >= *rmax*

These settings are required so that a neighbor list can be created to
search for nearby atoms.  Pairs of atoms that are already bonded
cannot appear in the neighbor list, to avoid creation of duplicate
bonds.  The neighbor list for all atom type pairs must also extend to
a distance that encompasses the *rmax* for new bonds to create.

.. note::

   If you want to create bonds between pairs of 1-3 or 1-4 atoms in
   the current bond topology, then you need to use :doc:`special_bonds
   lj 0 1 1 <special_bonds>` to insure those pairs appear in the
   neighbor list.  They will not appear with the default special_bonds
   settings which are zero for 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4 atoms.  1-3 or 1-4
   atoms are those which are 2 hops or 3 hops apart in the bond
   topology.

An additional requirement for this style is that your system must be
ready to perform a simulation.  This means, for example, that all
:doc:`pair_style <pair_style>` coefficients be set via the
:doc:`pair_coeff <pair_coeff>` command.  A :doc:`bond_style <bond_style>`
command and all bond coefficients must also be set, even if no bonds
exist before this command is invoked.  This is because the building of
neighbor list requires initialization and setup of a simulation,
similar to what a :doc:`run <run>` command would require.

Note that you can change any of these settings after this command
executes, e.g. if you wish to use long-range Coulombic interactions
via the :doc:`kspace_style <kspace_style>` command for your subsequent
simulation.

----------

The *single/bond* style creates a single bond of type *btype* between
two atoms with IDs *batom1* and *batom2*\ .  *Btype* must be a value
between 1 and the number of bond types defined.

The *single/angle* style creates a single angle of type *atype*
between three atoms with IDs *aatom1*, *aatom2*, and *aatom3*\ .  The
ordering of the atoms is the same as in the *Angles* section of a data
file read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>` command.  I.e. the 3 atoms are
ordered linearly within the angle; the central atom is *aatom2*\ .
*Atype* must be a value between 1 and the number of angle types
defined.

The *single/dihedral* style creates a single dihedral of type *dtype*
between four atoms with IDs *datom1*, *datom2*, *datom3*, and *datom4*\ .  The
ordering of the atoms is the same as in the *Dihedrals* section of a data file
read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>` command.  I.e. the 4 atoms are ordered
linearly within the dihedral.  *dtype* must be a value between 1 and
the number of dihedral types defined.

The *single/improper* style creates a single improper of type *itype*
between four atoms with IDs *iatom1*, *iatom2*, *iatom3*, and *iatom4*\ .  The
ordering of the atoms is the same as in the *Impropers* section of a data file
read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>` command.  I.e. the 4 atoms are ordered
linearly within the improper.  *itype* must be a value between 1 and
the number of improper types defined.

----------

The keyword *special* controls whether an internal list of special
bonds is created after one or more bonds, or a single angle, dihedral or
improper is added to the system.

The default value is *yes*\ .  A value of *no* cannot be used
with the *many* style.

This is an expensive operation since the bond topology for the system
must be walked to find all 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 interactions to store in an
internal list, which is used when pairwise interactions are weighted;
see the :doc:`special_bonds <special_bonds>` command for details.

Thus if you are adding a few bonds or a large list of angles all at
the same time, by using this command repeatedly, it is more efficient
to only trigger the internal list to be created once, after the last
bond (or angle, or dihedral, or improper) is added:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   create_bonds single/bond 5 52 98 special no
   create_bonds single/bond 5 73 74 special no
   ...
   create_bonds single/bond 5 17 386 special no
   create_bonds single/bond 4 112 183 special yes

Note that you MUST insure the internal list is re-built after the last
bond (angle, dihedral, improper) is added, before performing a simulation.
Otherwise pairwise interactions will not be properly excluded or
weighted.  LAMMPS does NOT check that you have done this correctly.
