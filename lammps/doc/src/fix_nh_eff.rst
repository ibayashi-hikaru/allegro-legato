Description
"""""""""""

These commands perform time integration on Nose-Hoover style
non-Hamiltonian equations of motion for nuclei and electrons in the
group for the :doc:`electron force field <pair_eff>` model.  The fixes
are designed to generate positions and velocities sampled from the
canonical (nvt), isothermal-isobaric (npt), and isenthalpic (nph)
ensembles.  This is achieved by adding some dynamic variables which
are coupled to the particle velocities (thermostatting) and simulation
domain dimensions (barostatting).  In addition to basic thermostatting
and barostatting, these fixes can also create a chain of thermostats
coupled to the particle thermostat, and another chain of thermostats
coupled to the barostat variables. The barostat can be coupled to the
overall box volume, or to individual dimensions, including the *xy*,
*xz* and *yz* tilt dimensions. The external pressure of the barostat
can be specified as either a scalar pressure (isobaric ensemble) or as
components of a symmetric stress tensor (constant stress ensemble).
When used correctly, the time-averaged temperature and stress tensor
of the particles will match the target values specified by
Tstart/Tstop and Pstart/Pstop.

The operation of these fixes is exactly like that described by the
:doc:`fix nvt, npt, and nph <fix_nh>` commands, except that the radius
and radial velocity of electrons are also updated.  Likewise the
temperature and pressure calculated by the fix, using the computes it
creates (as discussed in the :doc:`fix nvt, npt, and nph <fix_nh>`
doc page), are performed with computes that include the eFF contribution
to the temperature or kinetic energy from the electron radial velocity.

.. note::

   there are two different pressures that can be reported for eFF
   when defining the pair_style (see :doc:`pair eff/cut <pair_eff>` to
   understand these settings), one (default) that considers electrons do
   not contribute radial virial components (i.e. electrons treated as
   incompressible 'rigid' spheres) and one that does.  The radial
   electronic contributions to the virials are only tallied if the
   flexible pressure option is set, and this will affect both global and
   per-atom quantities.  In principle, the true pressure of a system is
   somewhere in between the rigid and the flexible eFF pressures, but,
   for most cases, the difference between these two pressures will not be
   significant over long-term averaged runs (i.e. even though the energy
   partitioning changes, the total energy remains similar).

.. note::

   currently, there is no available option for the user to set or
   create temperature distributions that include the radial electronic
   degrees of freedom with the :doc:`velocity <velocity>` command, so the
   the user must allow for these degrees of freedom to equilibrate
   (i.e. equi-partitioning of energy) through time integration.

for details.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix is part of the EFF package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info.

Other restriction discussed on the page for the :doc:`fix nvt, npt, and nph <fix_nh>` commands also apply.

.. note::

   The temperature for systems (regions or groups) with only
   electrons and no nuclei is 0.0 (i.e. not defined) in the current
   temperature calculations, a practical example would be a uniform
   electron gas or a very hot plasma, where electrons remain delocalized
   from the nuclei.  This is because, even though electron virials are
   included in the temperature calculation, these are averaged over the
   nuclear degrees of freedom only.  In such cases a corrective term must
   be added to the pressure to get the correct kinetic contribution.
