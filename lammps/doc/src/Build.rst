Build LAMMPS
============

LAMMPS is built as a library and an executable from source code using
either traditional makefiles for use with GNU make (which may require
manual editing), or using a build environment generated by CMake (Unix
Makefiles, Ninja, Xcode, Visual Studio, KDevelop, CodeBlocks and more).

As an alternative you can download a package with pre-built executables
or automated build trees as described on the :doc:`Install <Install>`
page.
