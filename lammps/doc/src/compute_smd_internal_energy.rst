.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute 1 all smd/internal/energy

Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation which outputs the per-particle enthalpy, i.e.,
the sum of potential energy and heat.

See `this PDF guide <PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf>`_ to use Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

Output Info
"""""""""""

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.
See the :doc:`Howto output <Howto_output>` page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle vector values will be given in :doc:`units <units>` of energy.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This compute is part of the MACHDYN package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info. This compute can
only be used for particles which interact via the updated Lagrangian
or total Lagrangian SPH pair styles.
