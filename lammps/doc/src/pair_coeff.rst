Description
"""""""""""

Specify the pairwise force field coefficients for one or more pairs of
atom types.  The number and meaning of the coefficients depends on the
pair style.  Pair coefficients can also be set in the data file read
by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>` command or in a restart file.

I and J can be specified in one of two ways.  Explicit numeric values
can be used for each, as in the first example above.  I <= J is
required.  LAMMPS sets the coefficients for the symmetric J,I
interaction to the same values.

A wildcard asterisk can be used in place of or in conjunction with the
I,J arguments to set the coefficients for multiple pairs of atom
types.  This takes the form "\*" or "\*n" or "n\*" or "m\*n".  If N = the
number of atom types, then an asterisk with no numeric values means all
types from 1 to N.  A leading asterisk means all types from 1 to n
(inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all types from n to N
(inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all types from m to n
(inclusive).  Note that only type pairs with I <= J are considered; if
asterisks imply type pairs where J < I, they are ignored.

Note that a pair_coeff command can override a previous setting for the
same I,J pair.  For example, these commands set the coeffs for all I,J
pairs, then overwrite the coeffs for just the I,J = 2,3 pair:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   pair_coeff * * 1.0 1.0 2.5
   pair_coeff 2 3 2.0 1.0 1.12

A line in a data file that specifies pair coefficients uses the exact
same format as the arguments of the pair_coeff command in an input
script, with the exception of the I,J type arguments.  In each line of
the "Pair Coeffs" section of a data file, only a single type I is
specified, which sets the coefficients for type I interacting with
type I.  This is because the section has exactly N lines, where N =
the number of atom types.  For this reason, the wild-card asterisk
should also not be used as part of the I argument.  Thus in a data
file, the line corresponding to the first example above would be listed
as

.. parsed-literal::

   2 1.0 1.0 2.5

For many potentials, if coefficients for type pairs with I != J are
not set explicitly by a pair_coeff command, the values are inferred
from the I,I and J,J settings by mixing rules; see the
:doc:`pair_modify <pair_modify>` command for a discussion.  Details on
this option as it pertains to individual potentials are described on
the page for the potential.

Many pair styles, typically for many-body potentials, use tabulated
potential files as input, when specifying the pair_coeff command.
Potential files provided with LAMMPS are in the potentials directory
of the distribution.  For some potentials, such as EAM, other archives
of suitable files can be found on the Web.  They can be used with
LAMMPS so long as they are in the format LAMMPS expects, as discussed
on the individual doc pages.  The first line of potential files may
contain metadata with upper case tags followed their value. These may
be parsed and used by LAMMPS.  Currently supported are the "DATE:"
tag and the ``UNITS:`` tag.  For pair styles that have been programmed
to support the metadata, the value of the "DATE:" tag is printed to
the screen and logfile so that the version of a potential file can be
later identified.  The ``UNITS:`` tag indicates the :doc:`units <units>`
setting required for this particular potential file.  If the potential
file was created for a different sets of units, LAMMPS will terminate
with an error.  If the potential file does not contain the tag, no
check will be made and it is the responsibility of the user to determine
that the unit style is correct.

In some select cases and for specific combinations of unit styles,
LAMMPS is capable of automatically converting potential parameters
from a file. In those cases, a warning message signaling that an
automatic conversion has happened is printed to the screen.

When a pair_coeff command using a potential file is specified, LAMMPS
looks for the potential file in 2 places.  First it looks in the
location specified.  E.g. if the file is specified as "niu3.eam", it
is looked for in the current working directory.  If it is specified as
"../potentials/niu3.eam", then it is looked for in the potentials
directory, assuming it is a sister directory of the current working
directory.  If the file is not found, it is then looked for in one of
the directories specified by the ``LAMMPS_POTENTIALS`` environment variable.
Thus if this is set to the potentials directory in the LAMMPS distribution,
then you can use those files from anywhere on your system, without
copying them into your working directory.  Environment variables are
set in different ways for different shells.  Here are example settings
for

csh, tcsh:

.. parsed-literal::

   % setenv LAMMPS_POTENTIALS /path/to/lammps/potentials

bash:

.. parsed-literal::

   % export LAMMPS_POTENTIALS=/path/to/lammps/potentials

Windows:

.. parsed-literal::

   % set LAMMPS_POTENTIALS="C:\\Path to LAMMPS\\Potentials"

The ``LAMMPS_POTENTIALS`` environment variable may contain paths
to multiple folders, if they are separated by ";" on Windows and
":" on all other operating systems, just like the ``PATH`` and
similar environment variables.

----------

The alphabetic list of pair styles defined in LAMMPS is given on the
:doc:`pair_style <pair_style>` doc page.  They are also listed in more
compact form on the :doc:`Commands pair <Commands_pair>` doc page.

Click on the style to display the formula it computes and its
coefficients as specified by the associated pair_coeff command.
