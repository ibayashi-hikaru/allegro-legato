History of LAMMPS</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="README.html">Return</A> to top-level of LAMMPS documentation.</P>
<P>
This is a brief history of features added to each version of LAMMPS.</P>
<HR>
<H3>
LAMMPS 2001 - November 2001</H3>
<UL>
    <LI>
    F90 + MPI version of code 
    <LI>
    dynamic memory, no param.h file settings to twiddle, see "extra memory"
    command
    <LI>
    changed required ordering of some input script commands (see discussion in
    <A HREF="input_commands.html">input_commands</A>) file
    <LI>
    new commands: "extra memory", "maximum cutoff", "restart version",
    "angle coeff", "dihedral coeff", "improper coeff",
    "volume control", "slab volume", "rotation zero"
    <LI>
    changed meaning or syntax of commands:
    "special bonds", "fix style rescale", "fix style hoover/drag",
    "temp control rescale", "press control", "restart"
    <LI>
    deleted commands: "log file", "press_x control" (and y,z)
    <LI>
    better match to CHARMM force fields via "nonbond style lj/charmm",
    "coulomb style charmm/switch", "angle style charmm", dihedral style charmm"
    (due to Mark Stevens and Paul Crozier)
    <LI>
    changed "special bonds" default to 0.0 weighting on 1-4 interactions for
    CHARMM compatibility, added "special bonds amber" option for AMBER
    compatibility
    <LI>
    ghost atoms and new treatment of periodic boundary conditions, 
    this allows for cutoffs &gt; box-size and faster neighbor binning,
    binned neighbor list construction is now the default as it is almost
    always faster
    <LI>
    perform blocked-input from data and restart files, faster for many MPI 
    implementations (due to Mathias Puetz)
    <LI>
    added Velocities option to data file to initialize each atom's
    velocity (see <A HREF="data_format.html">data_format</A> file) 
    <LI>
    pressure control was decoupled from temperature control, so that
    constant NPH simulations can be run (not just NPT), temperature 
    controls such as rescale or Langevin can now be used with constant P
    simulations (due to Mark Stevens)
    <LI>
    temperature rescaling (either in "temp control" or "fix style rescale")
    has an added fractional parameter which allows it to be applied
    in a lightweight or heavy-handed way to induce the desired temperature
    <LI>
    got rid of crib.html file, see global.f for documentation of all 
    variables
    <LI>
    2-d slab Ewald and PPPM option, (see "slab volume" in
    <A HREF="input_commands.html">input commands</A>) (due to Paul Crozier)
    <LI>
    new multiharmonic dihedral and cvff improper force-field options
    (due to Mathias Puetz)
    <LI>
    SHAKE constraint for small clusters of atoms, see "fix style shake"
    and "assign fix bondtype" commands
    <LI>
    added option to output restart files with timestep stamp or to toggle
    between 2 files, see "restart" command
    <LI>
    tools for converting to/from other MD program formats:
    msi2lmp (updated by John Carpenter),
    lmp2arc (due to John Carpenter),
    amber2lammps & dump2trj (Python scripts due to Keir Novik)
    <LI>
    tools for creating and massaging LAMMPS data and restart files:
    setup_lj, setup_flow_2d, setup_chain, peek_restart, restart2data,
    replicate
</UL>
<HR>
<H3>
LAMMPS 99 - June 99 </H3>
<UL>
    <LI>
    all-MPI version of code (F77 + C + MPI) for maximum portablility 
    <LI>
    only one PPPM choice now, the better of the two earlier ones 
    <LI>
    PPPM uses portable FFTs and data remapping routines, written in C w/ 
    MPI, can now use non-power-of-2 processors and grid sizes 
    <LI>
    auto-mapping of simulation box to processors 
    <LI>
    removed a few unused/unneeded commands (bdump, log file, id string, 
    limit) 
    <LI>
    changed syntax of some commands for simplicity &amp; consistency (see <A
     HREF="input_commands.html">input commands</A>) 
    <LI>
    changed method of calling/writing user diagnostic routines to be 
    simpler 
    <LI>

    Mark Stevens)
    <LI>
    new version of msi2lmp pre-processing tool, does not require DISCOVER 
    to run, only DISCOVER force field files (due to Steve Lustig)
