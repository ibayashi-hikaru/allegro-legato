LAMMPS Input Commands</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="README.html">Return</A> to top-level of LAMMPS documentation.</P>
<P>
This page contains a complete list of valid LAMMPS commands which are 
read-in from an input script. It will be easiest to understand if you 
read it while looking at sample input scripts in the examples 
directory. </P>
<P>
The script of input commands is read by LAMMPS, one line at a time. 
Each command causes LAMMPS to take some action. Usually it simply 
causes some internal variable(s) to be set. Or it may cause a data file 
to be read in or a simulation to be run. Note that most commands have 
default settings, which means you only need use a particular command if 
you do not want the default setting.</P>
<P>
Each LAMMPS input script contains exactly one &quot;read data&quot; (or 
&quot;read restart&quot;) command which defines the problem to be 
simulated. All other commands can be split into three categories: (a) 
commands that (if used) must appear before the &quot;read data&quot; 
command because they define settings needed to correctly read-in the 
problem and allocate memory for it, (b) commands that must appear after 
the &quot;read data&quot; command because they act on the specified 
problem, and (c) commands that can appear either before or after the 
&quot;read data&quot; command. Commands in category (c) are used before 
the &quot;read data&quot; command if a default setting needs to be 
changed before the problem description is read-in. They can be used 
after the &quot;read data&quot; command if the user wishes to change a 
setting before the next &quot;run&quot; or &quot;minimize&quot; command 
is used. Other than these restrictions, commands can generally appear 
in any order in the input script, although some commands require others 
to have been previously specified.</P>
<P>
Each LAMMPS input script also contains one or more &quot;run&quot; or 
&quot;minimize&quot; commands. These trigger an actual dynamics or 
minimization computation to be done. Following a run, new commands from 
categories (b) and (c) can be used to change various settings, and 
additional &quot;run&quot; commands can then be used to continue the 
previous simulation. LAMMPS continues to read successive lines from the 
input script until the end-of-file is reached, which causes LAMMPS to 
terminate.</P>
<P>
This page gives examples of each command, some of which can be 
specified in multiple styles. Typically the commands take one or more 
parameters. The keyword for each command should begin in the leftmost 
column and all characters in the command and its parameters should be 
in lower-case (except the word NULL or characters in filenames). 
Parameters can be separated by arbitrary numbers of spaces and/or tabs, 
so long as the command fits on one line. The remainder of the line 
after the last parameter is ignored.</P>
<P>
The next section outlines the structure of a LAMMPS input script. The 
final section gives a detailed description of the commands in 
alphabetic order, each with its associated parameters and default 
settings.</P>

assign a group of atoms or a bond type to a particular constraint
use appropriate number of coeffs for a particular style
the constraint itself must first be defined by a 
  &quot;fix style&quot; command
multiple groups of atoms or bond types can be assigned to the same constraint
the bondtype option can only be assigned to a "fix style" of "shake",
  multiple bondtypes can be SHAKEn, so long as the size of clusters of
  atoms does not exceed the limit described in the "fix style" command
the angletype option can only be assigned to a "fix style" of "shake",
  only a single angletype can be SHAKEn, it is designed to be used
  in conjunction with "fix style bondtype" to make clusters of size 3
  entirely rigid (e.g. water)
the angletype option enables an additional check when SHAKE constraints
  are computed: if a cluster is of size 3 and both bonds in
  the cluster are of a bondtype specified by the 2nd parameter of
  angletype, then the cluster is SHAKEn with an additional angle
  constraint that makes it rigid, using the equilibrium angle appropriate
  to the specified angletype
IMPORTANT NOTE: the angletype option has one additional affect, namely
  that no angle forces for any angle of type angletype are computed
  (since it is assumed those angles will be frozen by being SHAKEn), thus
  it will likely cause unintended behavior if the bonds in some atom pairs
  within angles of type angletype do not have the appropriate bondtype,
  since they will not be SHAKEn but neither will the angle force by computed
for style region, a coeff of INF means + or - infinity (all the way 
  to the boundary)
an atom can be assigned to multiple constraints, the constraints will be
  applied in the reverse order they are assigned to that atom
  (e.g. each timestep, the last fix assigned to an atom will be applied 
  to it first, then the next-to-last applied second, etc)

use appropriate number of coeffs for a particular style
normally this command should be used before &quot;read data&quot; or &quot;read restart&quot;
  (if simulating a charged system) to tell LAMMPS how big a force cutoff
  is being used, the &quot;maximum cutoff&quot; command can also serve this
  purpose
restart files do not store &quot;coulomb style&quot; choice or cutoff, so
  this should be specified in the input script when running from a restart
  file
this command can also be used after &quot;read data&quot; or &quot;read restart&quot; to
  change the style of Coulomb interactions or the cutoff
if simulated system has no charges, should set &quot;coulomb style none&quot; to
  prevent LAMMPS from doing useless nonbond work, LAMMPS will set
  this for you and issue a warning
cutoff distance can be smaller or larger than simulation box dimensions
accuracy criterion means &quot;one part in value&quot; - e.g. 1.0E-4
Ewald and PPPM accuracy criterion are used in conjunction with cutoff
  to partition work between short-range and long-range routines
accuracy criterion effectively determines how many k-space vectors are used
  to approximate the energy and forces
for PPPM, accuracy criterion determines mesh spacing (see &quot;particle mesh&quot;
  command)
3-d periodic boundary conditions are normally used in conjunction with
  Ewald and PPPM, see &quot;slab volume&quot; command for 2-d Ewald/PPPM
cannot use any Coulomb styles other than none with nonbond style = lj/shift or
  nonbond style = soft
Coulomb style = smooth should be used with nonbond style = lj/smooth,
  and both should use same inner and outer cutoffs
nonbond style = lj/charmm should be used with coulomb style = charmm/switch
for smooth and charmm/switch styles, outer cutoff must be &gt; inner cutoff
for smooth and charmm/switch styles, atom pairs less than the inner cutoff
  distance use usual Coulomb, pairs between inner and outer are smoothed,
  and the potential goes to 0.0 at the outer cutoff
for smooth style, force is continuously differentiable everywhere
for debye style, an exp(-kappa*r) screening is added to the Coulombic
  interaction

define a constraint
cannot skip a constraint number, all must be used before a run is performed
use appropriate number of coeffs for a particular style
which atoms or bonds the constraint will affect is set by the
  "assign fix" command
all of the constraints (except for rescale) are applied every timestep
all specified temperatures are in temperature units
for style setforce, a coeff of NULL means do not alter that force component
for style aveforce, average force on the group of fixed atoms is computed,
  then new average force is added in and actual force on each atom is set
  to new total value -> has effect of applying same force to entire group
  of atoms
thermostatting constraints (rescale, hoover/drag, langevin) cannot be used in
  conjunction with global &quot;temp control&quot;, since they conflict and will
  cause atom velocities to be reset twice
thermostatting constraints (rescale, hoover/drag, langevin) cannot be used
  when performing a minimization
if multiple Langevin constraints are specified the Marsaglia RNG will
  only use the last RNG seed specified for initialization
meaning of rescale and Langevin thermostatting coefficients is same as in 
  &quot;temp control&quot; command
for rescale style, it can be used as a coarse temperature rescaler,
  for example &quot;rescale 200.0 300.0 100 10.0 1.0&quot; will ramp the temperature
  up during the simulation, resetting it to the target temperature as needed
for rescale style, it can be used to create an instantaneous
  drag force that slowly rescales the temperature without oscillation,
  for example &quot;rescale 300.0 300.0 1 0.0 0.0001&quot; will force (or keep) 
  the temperature to be 300.0, the time frame over which this occurs
  will become longer as the last parameter is made smaller
for hoover/drag style, the drag force accumulates over time so some
  oscillation in temperature can occur, for example
  &quot;rescale 300.0 300.0 1 0.0 0.0001&quot; will force (or keep)
  the temperature to be 300.0, the time frame over which the oscillations
  occur will become longer as the last parameter is made smaller
style springforce is designed to be applied to an entire group of atoms
  en masse (e.g. an umbrella force on an entire molecule)
for springforce style, the center of mass r0 of the group of atoms is computed,
  then a restoring force = -k*(r-r0)*mass/masstotal is applied to each 
  atom in the group where mass = mass of the atom and masstotal = mass of
  all the atoms in the group - thus &quot;k&quot; should represent the total
  force on the group of atoms (not per atom)
for springforce style, a xyz position of NULL means do not include that
  dimension in the distance or force computation
for dragforce style, apply a drag force of magnitude f to each atom in the
  group in the direction (r-r0) where r0 = (x,y,z) - do not apply the force if
  the atom is within a distance delta of r0
for dragforce style, a xyz position of NULL means do not include that
  dimension in the distance or force computation
for shake style, certain bonds in the system are constrained every timestep
  to be at their equilibrium length, this is done by applying a SHAKE-like
  constraint to the forces on the atoms so that their position at the next
  timestep will preserve the atom separations
for shake style, only atoms in small clusters can be constrained -
  e.g. water molecules, CH3 groups, but not the C backbone of a
  long polymer chain - a cluster is defined as a central atom
  connected to others in the cluster by constrained bonds connected
  together by constrained bonds - the max size of such a cluster is
  4 atoms to enable easier parallelization
for shake style, the max iteration count need not be large (e.g. 3) since
  iterations are only done within a cluster and converge quickly
see the &quot;minimize&quot; command for what constraints are allowed for use
  with the minimizer
see the &quot;respa&quot; command for how constraints are applied when rRESPA
  timestepping is enabled

if the value is inaccurate (e.g. the command is not used), it is not an

this command is not typically needed if the &quot;nonbond style&quot; and &quot;coulomb style&quot;

  they specify the appropriate cutoffs
an exception to this is if a short cutoff is used initially,

define style of pairwise nonbond interactions to use between all atom types
use appropriate number of coeffs for a particular style
this is separate from charge interactions (see &quot;coulomb style&quot; command)
normally this command should be used before &quot;read data&quot;
  to tell LAMMPS how big a force cutoff is being used, the 
  &quot;maximum cutoff&quot; command can also serve this purpose
when running from a restart file, the restart file contains the nonbond
  style and nonbond cutoffs (but not the offset flag), so it is often
  not necessary to use a &quot;nonbond style&quot; command before &quot;read restart&quot;,
  however LAMMPS still needs to know what the maximum cutoff will be
  before the restart file is read, see &quot;maximum cutoff&quot; command
  for more details
this command can also be used after &quot;read data&quot; or &quot;read restart&quot; to
  change the style of nonbond interactions and/or the cutoff
cutoff distance can be smaller or larger than simulation box dimensions
nonbond style determines how many nonbond coefficients the program expects to
  find in a &quot;Nonbond Coeffs&quot; entry in the data file or when using the 
  &quot;nonbond coeff&quot; command, thus the style must be set (if not using default)
  before using the &quot;read data&quot; command (if the data file contains a 
  &quot;Nonbond Coeffs&quot; entry) or a &quot;nonbond coeff&quot; command
coefficients for all atom type pairs must be defined in data (or restart)
  file by a &quot;Nonbond Coeffs&quot; entry or by &quot;nonbond coeffs&quot; commands before
  a run is performed
this command sets the cutoff(s) for all type pair interactions, thus
  overriding any previous settings by a &quot;nonbond coeff&quot; command or
  that were read in from a data or restart file
for lj/cutoff, lj/shift, class2/cutoff styles, 
  offset flag only affects printout of thermodynamic energy
  (not forces or dynamics), determines whether offset energy 
  is added in to LJ potential to make value at cutoff = 0.0,
  flag = 0 -&gt; do not add in offset energy,
  flag = 1 -&gt; add in offset energy 
for lj/smooth and lj/charmm styles, outer cutoff must be &gt; inner cutoff
for lj/smooth and lj/charmm styles, atom pairs less than the inner cutoff
  distance use straight LJ, pairs between inner and outer use a smoothed LJ,
   and the potential goes to 0.0 at the outer cutoff
for lj/smooth and lj/charmm styles, energy and forces are continuous at inner
   cutoff and go smoothly to zero at outer cutoff
for lj/shift and soft styles, must set &quot;coulomb style&quot; to &quot;none&quot;
for lj/charmm style, must set &quot;coulomb style&quot; to &quot;charmm/switch&quot;, &quot;pppm&quot;,
   or &quot;ewald&quot;
for lj/shift style, delta shift distances for each atom pair are set by
  &quot;Nonbond Coeffs&quot; entry in data file or by &quot;nonbond coeffs&quot; command
for soft style, values of the prefactor &quot;A&quot;, which is ramped from one
  value to another during the run, are set by &quot;Nonbond Coeffs&quot; entry
  in data file or by &quot;nonbond coeffs&quot; command

enable constant pressure simulations
all specified pressures are in pressure units
any dimension being varied by pressure control must be periodic
for xyz coupling, all 3 dimensions expand/contract together uniformly
  using total scalar pressure as the driving force
for xy/yz/xz coupling, the 2 specified dimensions expand/contract together
  uniformly using pressure components averaged over those 2 dimensions
  as the driving force, the non-specified dimension will expand/contract
  independently using its pressure component as the driving force
for anisotropic, all 3 dimensions expand/contract independently using
  individual pressure components as the 3 driving forces
in all cases, the simulation box stays rectilinear (not Parinello-Rahman)
for dimensions coupled together, their specified P values should be the same
a non-coupled dimension (e.g. dimension z for xy option or any dimension
  for aniso option) can have 2 NULL values as specified pressures,
  which means apply no pressure control in that dimension (constant volume)
target pressure at intermediate points during a run is a ramped value
  between the beginning and ending pressure(s)
for nose/hoover style, frequency constant is like an inverse &quot;piston&quot; 
  mass which determines how rapidly the pressure fluctuates in response to a
  restoring force, large frequency -&gt; small mass -&gt; rapid fluctations
for nose/hoover style, units of frequency/damping constant are
  inverse time, so a value of 0.001 means relax in a timespan on the 
  order of 1000 fmsec (real units) or 1000 tau (LJ units)
IMPORTANT NOTE: the computation of P in LAMMPS does not include

the restart file stores the constraint assignments for each atom generated

enable constant temperature simulations
use appropriate number of coeffs for a particular style
all specified temperatures are in temperature units
target temperature at intermediate points during run is a ramped value
  between the beginning and ending temperatures
for rescale style, temperature is controlled by explicitly rescaling
  velocities towards the target temperature
for rescale style, rescaling is only done if current temperature is
  beyond the target temperature plus or minus the window value
for rescale style, the amount of rescaling is contfolled by the fractional
  amount (0.0 to 1.0), e.g. a value of 0.5 means set the velocities
  to halfway between the current and target temperature
for rescale style, it can be used as a coarse temperature rescaler,
  for example "rescale 200.0 300.0 100 10.0 1.0" will ramp the temperature
  up during the simulation, resetting it to the target temperature as needed
for rescale style, it can be used to create an instantaneous
  drag force that slowly rescales the temperature without oscillation,
  for example "rescale 300.0 300.0 1 0.0 0.0001" will force (or keep) 
  the temperature to be 300.0, the time frame over which this occurs
  will become longer as the last parameter is made smaller
for replace style, Gaussian RNs from the Marsaglia RNG are used
for langevin style, uniform RNs from the Marsaglia RNG are used
for replace and langevin styles, the seed is used to initialize the
  Marsaglia RNG, on successive runs the RNG will just continue on
for replace and langevin styles, generated RNs depend on # of processors
  so will not get same answers independent of # of processors
for replace and langevin styles, RNG states are not saved in restart file,
  so cannot do an exact restart
for langevin style, damping parameter means small value -> less damping
for nose/hoover style, frequency constant is like an inverse 
  &quot;piston&quot; mass which determines how rapidly the temperature 
  fluctuates in response to a restoring force, large frequency -&gt; 
  small mass -&gt; rapid fluctations
for nose/hoover style, cannot use a end-of-run T of 0.0, must be finite
for langevin and nose/hoover styles, units of frequency/damping constant are
  inverse time, so a value of 0.01 means relax in a timespan on the

for LJ units, LAMMPS sets global epsilon,sigma,mass all equal to 1.0
subsequent input numbers in data and command file must be in these units
output numbers to screen and log and dump files will be in these units
this command (if it appears) must be the first command (aside from
  comments) in the input script
must be set before data or restart file is read

enable volume changes (density changes) during a simulation
specified box boundaries are in distance units
each dimension is controlled separately
dimensions not specified by a &quot;volume control&quot; command can be left
  alone (constant volume or nonperiodic) or controlled by
  a &quot;press control&quot; command
any dimension being varied by volume control must be periodic
the lo/hi values are the desired global simulation box boundaries at
  the end of the simulation run
at each timestep, the box is expanded/contracted uniformly from its initial
  lo/hi values to the specified ending lo/hi values
initial lo/hi values are specified in the data or restart file or 
  inherited from the end of the previous run
at each timestep, all atom coordinates are also scaled to the new box

Default = none
