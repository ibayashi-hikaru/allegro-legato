LAMMPS = Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator</P>
<P>
This is the documentation for the LAMMPS 2001 version, written in F90,
which has been superseded by more current versions.  See the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/lammps.html">LAMMPS WWW
Site</A> for more information.
<P>
LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code designed for simulating 
molecular and atomic systems on parallel computers using 
spatial-decomposition techniques. It runs on any parallel platform that 
supports F90 and the MPI message-passing library or on single-processor 
workstations.</P>

distribute remains under the GPL.
<P>
Features of LAMMPS 2001 include:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    short-range pairwise Lennard-Jones and Coulombic interactions 
    <LI>
    long-range Coulombic interactions via Ewald or PPPM (particle-mesh 
    Ewald) 
    <LI>
    short-range harmonic bond potentials (bond, angle, torsion, improper) 
    <LI>
    short-range class II (cross-term) molecular potentials 
    <LI>
    NVE, NVT, NPT dynamics 
    <LI>
    constraints on atoms or groups of atoms 
    <LI>
    rRESPA long-timescale integrator 
    <LI>
    energy minimizer (Hessian-free truncated Newton method) 
</UL>
<P>
For users of LAMMPS 99, this version is written in F90 to take
advantage of dynamic memory allocation.  This means the user does not
have to fiddle with parameter settings and re-compile the code so
often for different problems.  This enhancment means there are new
rules for the ordering of commands in a LAMMPS input script, as well
as a few new commands to guide the memory allocator. Users should read
the beginning sections of the <A
HREF="input_commands.html">input_commands</A> file for an
explanation.</P>
<P>
More details about the code can be found <A
HREF="#_cch3_930958294">here</A>, in the HTML- or text-based
documentation.  The LAMMPS Web page is at <A
 HREF="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/lammps.html">www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/lammps.html</A>
, which includes benchmark timings and a list of papers written using
LAMMPS results.  They illustrate the kinds of scientific problems that
can be modeled with LAMMPS.  These two papers describe the parallel
algorithms used in the code.  Please cite these if you incorporate
LAMMPS results in your work.  And if you send me citations for your
papers, I'll be pleased to add them to the LAMMPS WWW page.

LAMMPS was originally developed as part of a 5-way CRADA collaboration 
between 3 industrial partners (Cray Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and 
Dupont) and 2 DoE laboratories (Sandia National Laboratories and 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories).</P>
