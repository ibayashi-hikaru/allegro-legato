Description
"""""""""""

Using a dihedral style of zero means dihedral forces and energies are
not computed, but the geometry of dihedral quadruplets is still
accessible to other commands.

As an example, the :doc:`compute dihedral/local <compute_dihedral_local>` command can be used to
compute the theta values for the list of quadruplets of dihedral atoms
listed in the data file read by the :doc:`read_data <read_data>`
command.  If no dihedral style is defined, this command cannot be
used.

The optional *nocoeff* flag allows to read data files with a DihedralCoeff
section for any dihedral style. Similarly, any dihedral_coeff commands
will only be checked for the dihedral type number and the rest ignored.

Note that the :doc:`dihedral_coeff <dihedral_coeff>` command must be
used for all dihedral types, though no additional values are
specified.
