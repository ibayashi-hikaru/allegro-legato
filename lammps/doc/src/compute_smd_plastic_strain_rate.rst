compute smd/plastic/strain/rate command
=======================================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute ID group-ID smd/plastic/strain/rate

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`compute <compute>` command
* smd/plastic/strain/rate = style name of this compute command

Examples
""""""""

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute 1 all smd/plastic/strain/rate

Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that outputs the time rate of the equivalent
plastic strain.  This command is only meaningful if a material model
with plasticity is defined.

See `this PDF guide <PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf>`_ to use Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

**Output Info:**

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.
See the :doc:`Howto output <Howto_output>` page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle values will be given in :doc:`units <units>` of one over time.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This compute is part of the MACHDYN package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info. This compute can
only be used for particles which interact via the updated Lagrangian
or total Lagrangian SPH pair styles.
