   fix 1 all nve/eff

Description
"""""""""""

Perform constant NVE integration to update position and velocity for
nuclei and electrons in the group for the :doc:`electron force field <pair_eff>` model.  V is volume; E is energy.  This creates a
system trajectory consistent with the microcanonical ensemble.

The operation of this fix is exactly like that described by the :doc:`fix nve <fix_nve>` command, except that the radius and radial velocity
of electrons are also updated.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.  None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.  This fix is not invoked during :doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix is part of the EFF package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info.
