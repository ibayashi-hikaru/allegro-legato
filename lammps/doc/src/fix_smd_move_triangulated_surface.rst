Description
"""""""""""

This fix applies only to rigid surfaces read from .STL files via fix
:doc:`smd/wall_surface <fix_smd_wall_surface>` .  It updates position
and velocity for the particles in the group each timestep without
regard to forces on the particles.  The rigid surfaces can thus be
moved along simple trajectories during the simulation.

The *\*LINEAR* style moves particles with the specified constant velocity
vector V = (Vx,Vy,Vz). This style also sets the velocity of each particle
to V = (Vx,Vy,Vz).

The *\*WIGGLE* style moves particles in an oscillatory fashion.
Particles are moved along (vx, vy, vz) with constant velocity until a
displacement of max_travel is reached. Then, the velocity vector is
reversed. This process is repeated.

The *\*ROTATE* style rotates particles around a rotation axis R =
(Rx,Ry,Rz) that goes through a point P = (Px,Py,Pz). The period of the
rotation is also specified. This style also sets the velocity of each
particle to (omega cross Rperp) where omega is its angular velocity
around the rotation axis and Rperp is a perpendicular vector from the
rotation axis to the particle.

Dynamics in LAMMPS.

Currently, no part of MACHDYN supports restarting nor
minimization. This fix has no outputs.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix is part of the MACHDYN package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info.
