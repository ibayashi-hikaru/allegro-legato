pair_style smd/ulsph command
============================

Syntax
""""""

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   pair_style smd/ulsph args

* these keywords must be given

.. parsed-literal::

   keyword = *\*DENSITY_SUMMATION* or *\*DENSITY_CONTINUITY* and *\*VELOCITY_GRADIENT* or *\*NO_VELOCITY_GRADIENT* and *\*GRADIENT_CORRECTION* or *\*NO_GRADIENT_CORRECTION*

Examples
""""""""

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   pair_style smd/ulsph *DENSITY_CONTINUITY *VELOCITY_GRADIENT *NO_GRADIENT_CORRECTION

Description
"""""""""""

The *smd/ulsph* style computes particle interactions according to
continuum mechanics constitutive laws and an updated Lagrangian
Smooth-Particle Hydrodynamics algorithm.

This pair style is invoked similar to the following command:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   pair_style smd/ulsph *DENSITY_CONTINUITY *VELOCITY_GRADIENT *NO_GRADIENT_CORRECTION
   pair_coeff i j *COMMON rho0 c0 Q1 Cp hg &
                  *END

Here, *i* and *j* denote the *LAMMPS* particle types for which this
pair style is defined. Note that *i* and *j* can be different, i.e.,
*ulsph* cross interactions between different particle types are
allowed. However, *i*\ --\ *i* respectively *j*\ --\ *j* pair_coeff lines have
to precede a cross interaction.  In contrast to the usual *LAMMPS*
*pair coeff* definitions, which are given solely a number of floats
and integers, the *ulsph* *pair coeff* definition is organized using
keywords. These keywords mark the beginning of different sets of
parameters for particle properties, material constitutive models, and
damage models. The *pair coeff* line must be terminated with the
*\*END* keyword. The use the line continuation operator *&* is
recommended. A typical invocation of the *ulsph* for a solid body
would consist of an equation of state for computing the pressure (the
diagonal components of the stress tensor), and a material model to
compute shear stresses (the off-diagonal components of the stress
tensor).

Note that the use of \*GRADIENT_CORRECTION can lead to severe numerical
instabilities. For a general fluid simulation, \*NO_GRADIENT_CORRECTION
is recommended.

Please see the `SMD user guide <PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf>`_ for a
complete listing of the possible keywords and material models.

Mixing, shift, table, tail correction, restart, rRESPA info
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

No mixing is performed automatically.  Currently, no part of MACHDYN
supports restarting nor minimization.  rRESPA does not apply to this
pair style.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix is part of the MACHDYN package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info.
