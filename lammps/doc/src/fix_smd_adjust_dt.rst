Description
"""""""""""

The fix calculates a new stable time increment for use with the SMD
time integrators.

The stable time increment is based on multiple conditions. For the SPH
pair styles, a CFL criterion (Courant, Friedrichs & Lewy, 1928) is
evaluated, which determines the speed of sound cannot propagate
further than a typical spacing between particles within a single time
step to ensure no information is lost. For the contact pair styles, a
linear analysis of the pair potential determines a stable maximum time
step.

This fix inquires the minimum stable time increment across all
particles contained in the group for which this fix is defined. An
additional safety factor *s_fact* is applied to the time increment.

Dynamics in LAMMPS.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix is part of the MACHDYN package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info.
