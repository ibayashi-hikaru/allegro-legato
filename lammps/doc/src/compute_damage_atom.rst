compute damage/atom command
===========================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   compute ID group-ID damage/atom

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`compute <compute>` command
* damage/atom = style name of this compute command

Examples
""""""""

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute 1 all damage/atom

Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that calculates the per-atom damage for each atom
in a group.  This is a quantity relevant for :doc:`Peridynamics models <pair_peri>`.  See `this document <PDF/PDLammps_overview.pdf>`_
for an overview of LAMMPS commands for Peridynamics modeling.

The "damage" of a Peridynamics particles is based on the bond breakage
between the particle and its neighbors.  If all the bonds are broken
the particle is considered to be fully damaged.

See the `PDLAMMPS user guide <http://www.sandia.gov/~mlparks/papers/PDLAMMPS.pdf>`_ for a formal
definition of "damage" and more details about Peridynamics as it is
implemented in LAMMPS.

This command can be used with all the Peridynamic pair styles.

The damage value will be 0.0 for atoms not in the specified compute
group.

Output info
"""""""""""

This compute calculates a per-atom vector, which can be accessed by
any command that uses per-atom values from a compute as input.  See
the :doc:`Howto output <Howto_output>` page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-atom vector values are unitless numbers (damage) >= 0.0.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This compute is part of the PERI package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info.
