The `Authors page <https://www.lammps.org/authors.html>`_ of the
`LAMMPS website <lws_>`_ has a comprehensive list of all the individuals
who have contributed code for a new feature or command or tool to
LAMMPS.

----------

The following folks deserve special recognition.  Many of the packages
they have written are unique for an MD code and LAMMPS would not be as
general-purpose as it is without their expertise and efforts.

* Metin Aktulga (MSU), REAXFF package for C/C++ version of ReaxFF
* Mike Brown (Intel), GPU and INTEL packages
* Colin Denniston (U Western Ontario), LATBOLTZ package
* Georg Ganzenmuller (EMI), MACHDYN and SPH packages
* Andres Jaramillo-Botero (Caltech), EFF package for electron force field
* Reese Jones (Sandia) and colleagues, ATC package for atom/continuum coupling
* Christoph Kloss (DCS Computing), LIGGGHTS code for granular materials, built on top of LAMMPS
* Rudra Mukherjee (JPL), POEMS package for articulated rigid body motion
* Trung Ngyuen (Northwestern U), GPU, RIGID, BODY, and DIELECTRIC packages
* Mike Parks (Sandia), PERI package for Peridynamics
* Roy Pollock (LLNL), Ewald and PPPM solvers
* Julien Tranchida (Sandia), SPIN package
* Christian Trott (Sandia), CUDA and KOKKOS packages
* Ilya Valuev (JIHT), AWPMD package for wave packet MD
* Greg Wagner (Northwestern U), MEAM package for MEAM potential

----------

As discussed on the `History page <https://www.lammps.org/history.html>`_ of the website, LAMMPS
originated as a cooperative project between DOE labs and industrial
partners.  Folks involved in the design and testing of the original
version of LAMMPS were the following:

* John Carpenter (Mayo Clinic, formerly at Cray Research)
* Terry Stouch (Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, formerly at Bristol Myers Squibb)
* Steve Lustig (Dupont)
* Jim Belak and Roy Pollock (LLNL)
