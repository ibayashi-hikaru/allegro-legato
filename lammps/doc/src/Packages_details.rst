Package details
===============

Here is a brief description of all packages in LAMMPS.  It lists authors
(if applicable) and summarizes the package contents.  It has specific
instructions on how to install the package, including, if necessary,
info on how to download or build any extra library it requires.  It also
gives links to documentation, example scripts, and pictures/movies (if
available) that illustrate use of the package.

The majority of packages can be included in a LAMMPS build with a
single setting (``-D PGK_<NAME>=on`` for CMake) or command
(``make yes-<name>`` for make).  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>`
page for more info.  A few packages may require additional steps;
this is indicated in the descriptions below.  The :doc:`Build extras <Build_extras>`
page gives those details.

.. note::

   To see the complete list of commands a package adds to LAMMPS,
   you can examine the files in its src directory, e.g. "ls
   src/GRANULAR".  Files with names that start with fix, compute, atom,
   pair, bond, angle, etc correspond to commands with the same style name
   as contained in the file name.

GPU package
-----------

**Contents:**

Dozens of pair styles and a version of the PPPM long-range Coulombic
solver optimized for GPUs.  All such styles have a "gpu" as a suffix

software is required on your system, and details on how to build and
use this package.  Its styles can be invoked at run time via the "-sf
gpu" or "-suffix gpu" :doc:`command-line switches <Run_options>`.  See

is provided by the :doc:`pair_style kim <pair_kim>` command.

.. note::

   The command *pair_style kim* is called by *kim interactions* and is not
   recommended to be directly used in input scripts.

To use this package you must have the KIM API library available on your
system. The KIM API is available for download on the
`OpenKIM website <https://openkim.org/kim-api/>`_.
When installing LAMMPS from binary, the kim-api package
is a dependency that is automatically downloaded and installed.

style name.  The :doc:`KOKKOS package <Speed_kokkos>` page gives
details of what hardware and software is required on your system, and
how to build and use this package.  Its styles can be invoked at run
time via the "-sf kk" or "-suffix kk" :doc:`command-line switches <Run_options>`.  Also see the :ref:`GPU <PKG-GPU>`, :ref:`OPT <PKG-OPT>`,
:ref:`INTEL <PKG-INTEL>`, and :ref:`OPENMP <PKG-OPENMP>` packages, which

**Contents:**

MESONT is a LAMMPS package for simulation of nanomechanics of
nanotubes (NTs). The model is based on a coarse-grained representation
of NTs as "flexible cylinders" consisting of a variable number of
segments. Internal interactions within a NT and the van der Waals
interaction between the tubes are described by a mesoscopic force field
designed and parameterized based on the results of atomic-level
molecular dynamics simulations. The description of the force field is
provided in the papers listed below. This package contains two
independent implementations of this model: :doc:`pair_style mesocnt
<pair_mesocnt>` is a (minimal) C++ implementation, and :doc:`pair_style
mesont/tpm <pair_mesont_tpm>` is a more general and feature rich
implementation based on a Fortran library in the ``lib/mesont`` folder.

**Download of potential files:**

The potential files for these pair styles are *very* large and thus
are not included in the regular downloaded packages of LAMMPS or the
git repositories.  Instead, they will be automatically downloaded
from a web server when the package is installed for the first time.

was originally developed by John Moriarty at LLNL.  The pair style in

.. _PKG-MOLFILE:

MOLFILE package
--------------------

**Contents:**

A :doc:`dump molfile <dump_molfile>` command which uses molfile plugins
that are bundled with the `VMD <vmd-home_>`_
molecular visualization and analysis program, to enable LAMMPS to dump
snapshots in formats compatible with various molecular simulation
tools.

To use this package you must have the desired VMD plugins available on
your system.

Note that this package only provides the interface code, not the
plugins themselves, which will be accessed when requesting a specific
plugin via the :doc:`dump molfile <dump_molfile>` command.  Plugins can
be obtained from a VMD installation which has to match the platform
that you are using to compile LAMMPS for. By adding plugins to VMD,
support for new file formats can be added to LAMMPS (or VMD or other
programs that use them) without having to re-compile the application
itself.  More information about the VMD molfile plugins can be found
at
`http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile>`_.

**Contents:**

The :doc:`OPENMP package <Speed_omp>` page gives details of what hardware
and compilers are required on your system, and how to build and use
this package.  Its styles can be invoked at run time via the "-sf omp"
or "-suffix omp" :doc:`command-line switches <Run_options>`.  Also see
the :ref:`KOKKOS <PKG-KOKKOS>`, :ref:`OPT <PKG-OPT>`, and :ref:`INTEL <PKG-INTEL>`
packages, which have styles optimized for CPUs.

**Author:** Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U).

.. note::

   To enable multi-threading support the compile flag "-fopenmp"
   and the link flag "-fopenmp" (for GNU compilers, you have to look up
   the equivalent flags for other compilers) must be used to build LAMMPS.
   When using Intel compilers, also the "-restrict" flag is required.
   The OPENMP package can be compiled without enabling OpenMP; then
   all code will be compiled as serial and the only improvement over the
   regular styles are some data access optimization. These flags should
   be added to the CCFLAGS and LINKFLAGS lines of your Makefile.machine.
   See src/MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.omp for an example.

Once you have an appropriate Makefile.machine, you can
install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the usual manner:

.. _PKG-QMMM:

the MM code in a QM/MM simulation.  This is currently only available
in combination with the `Quantum ESPRESSO <espresso_>`_ package.

.. _espresso: http://www.quantum-espresso.org

To use this package you must have Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) available on

then compile LAMMPS as a library.  For QM/MM calculations you then
build a custom binary with MPI support, that sets up 3 partitions with
MPI sub-communicators (for inter- and intra-partition communication)
and then calls the corresponding library interfaces on each partition
(2x LAMMPS and 1x QE).

The current implementation supports an ONIOM style mechanical coupling
and a multi-pole based electrostatic coupling to the Quantum ESPRESSO
plane wave DFT package.  The QM/MM interface has been written in a
manner that coupling to other QM codes should be possible without
changes to LAMMPS itself.
