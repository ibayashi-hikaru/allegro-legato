Description
"""""""""""

This command is a variant of the Nose-Hoover
:doc:`fix npt <fix_nh>` fix style.
It performs time integration of the Hugoniostat equations
of motion developed by Ravelo et al. :ref:`(Ravelo) <Ravelo1>`.
These equations compress the system to a state with average
axial stress or pressure equal to the specified target value
and that satisfies the Rankine-Hugoniot (RH)
jump conditions for steady shocks.

The compression can be performed
either
hydrostatically (using keyword *iso*, *aniso*, or *tri*\ ) or uniaxially
(using keywords *x*, *y*, or *z*\ ).  In the hydrostatic case,
the cell dimensions change dynamically so that the average axial stress
in all three directions converges towards the specified target value.
In the uniaxial case, the chosen cell dimension changes dynamically
so that the average
axial stress in that direction converges towards the target value. The
other two cell dimensions are kept fixed (zero lateral strain).

This leads to the following additional restrictions on the keywords:

* One and only one of the following keywords should be used: *iso*, *aniso*, *tri*, *x*, *y*, *z*
* The specified initial and final target pressures must be the same.
* The keywords *xy*, *xz*, *yz* may not be used.
* The only admissible value for the couple keyword is *xyz*, which has the same effect as keyword *iso*
* The *temp* keyword must be used to specify the time constant for kinetic energy relaxation, but initial and final target temperature values are ignored.

Essentially, a Hugoniostat simulation is an NPT simulation in which the
user-specified target temperature is replaced with a time-dependent
target temperature Tt obtained from the following equation:

.. math::

   T_t - T = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(P + P_0\right)\left(V_0 - V\right) + E_0 - E\right)}{N_{dof} k_B } = \Delta

where *T* and :math:`T_t` are the instantaneous and target temperatures,
*P* and :math:`P_0` are the instantaneous and reference pressures or axial stresses,
depending on whether hydrostatic or uniaxial compression is being
performed, *V* and :math:`V_0` are the instantaneous and reference volumes,
*E* and :math:`E_0` are the instantaneous and reference internal energy (potential
plus kinetic), :math:`N_{dof}` is the number of degrees of freedom used in the
definition of temperature, and :math:`k_B` is the Boltzmann constant. :math:`\Delta` is the
negative deviation of the instantaneous temperature from the target temperature.
When the system reaches a stable equilibrium, the value of :math:`\Delta` should
fluctuate about zero.

The values of :math:`E_0`, :math:`V_0`, and :math:`P_0` are the instantaneous values at the start of
the simulation. These can be overridden using the fix_modify keywords *e0*,
*v0*, and *p0* described below.

----------

.. note::

   Unlike the :doc:`fix temp/berendsen <fix_temp_berendsen>` command
   which performs thermostatting but NO time integration, this fix
   performs thermostatting/barostatting AND time integration.  Thus you
   should not use any other time integration fix, such as :doc:`fix nve <fix_nve>` on atoms to which this fix is applied.  Likewise,
   this fix should not be used on atoms that have their temperature
   controlled by another fix - e.g. by :doc:`fix langevin <fix_nh>` or :doc:`fix temp/rescale <fix_temp_rescale>` commands.

----------

This fix computes a temperature and pressure at each timestep.  To do
this, the fix creates its own computes of style "temp" and "pressure",
as if one of these two sets of commands had been issued:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute fix-ID_temp group-ID temp
   compute fix-ID_press group-ID pressure fix-ID_temp

   compute fix-ID_temp all temp
   compute fix-ID_press all pressure fix-ID_temp

See the :doc:`compute temp <compute_temp>` and :doc:`compute pressure <compute_pressure>` commands for details.  Note that the
IDs of the new computes are the fix-ID + underscore + "temp" or fix_ID
+ underscore + "press".  The group for
the new computes is "all" since pressure is computed for the entire
system.

Note that these are NOT the computes used by thermodynamic output (see
the :doc:`thermo_style <thermo_style>` command) with ID = *thermo_temp*
and *thermo_press*.  This means you can change the attributes of this
fix's temperature or pressure via the
:doc:`compute_modify <compute_modify>` command or print this temperature
or pressure during thermodynamic output via the :doc:`thermo_style custom <thermo_style>` command using the appropriate compute-ID.
It also means that changing attributes of *thermo_temp* or
*thermo_press* will have no effect on this fix.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This fix writes the values of :math:`E_0`, :math:`V_0`, and :math:`P_0`,
as well as the state of all the thermostat and barostat variables to
:doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.  See the :doc:`read_restart
<read_restart>` command for info on how to re-specify a fix in an input
script that reads a restart file, so that the operation of the fix
continues in an uninterrupted fashion.

The :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` *e0*, *v0* and *p0* keywords can be
used to define the values of :math:`E_0`, :math:`V_0`, and
:math:`P_0`. Note the the values for *e0* and *v0* are extensive, and so
must correspond to the total energy and volume of the entire system, not
energy and volume per atom. If any of these quantities are not
specified, then the instantaneous value in the system at the start of
the simulation is used.

The :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` *temp* and *press* options are
supported by this fix.  You can use them to assign a :doc:`compute
<compute>` you have defined to this fix which will be used in its
thermostatting or barostatting procedure, as described above.  If you
do this, note that the kinetic energy derived from the compute
temperature should be consistent with the virial term computed using
all atoms for the pressure.  LAMMPS will warn you if you choose to
compute temperature on a subset of atoms.

The cumulative energy change in the system imposed by this fix is
included in the :doc:`thermodynamic output <thermo_style>` keywords
*ecouple* and *econserve*.  See the :doc:`thermo_style <thermo_style>`
doc page for details.  Note that this energy is \*not\* included in
the definition of internal energy E when calculating the value of
Delta in the above equation.

This fix computes a global scalar which can be accessed by various
:doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.  The scalar is the same
cumulative energy change due to this fix described in the previous
paragraph.  The scalar value calculated by this fix is "extensive".

This fix also computes a global vector of quantities, which can be
accessed by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.  The scalar
The vector values are "intensive".

The vector stores three quantities unique to this fix (:math:`\Delta`,
Us, and up), followed by all the internal Nose/Hoover thermostat and
barostat variables defined for :doc:`fix npt <fix_nh>`. Delta is the
deviation of the temperature from the target temperature, given by the
above equation.  Us and up are the shock and particle velocity
corresponding to a steady shock calculated from the RH
conditions. They have units of distance/time.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix style is part of the SHOCK package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the :doc:`Build package
<Build_package>` page for more info.

All the usual restrictions for :doc:`fix npt <fix_nh>` apply, plus the
additional ones mentioned above.
