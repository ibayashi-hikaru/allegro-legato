Description
"""""""""""

This fix performs grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) exchanges of
atoms or molecules with an imaginary ideal gas
reservoir at the specified T and chemical potential (mu) as discussed
in :ref:`(Frenkel) <Frenkel2>`. It also
attempts  Monte Carlo (MC) moves (translations and molecule
rotations) within the simulation cell or
region. If used with the :doc:`fix nvt <fix_nh>`
command, simulations in the grand canonical ensemble (muVT, constant
chemical potential, constant volume, and constant temperature) can be
performed.  Specific uses include computing isotherms in microporous
materials, or computing vapor-liquid coexistence curves.

Every N timesteps the fix attempts both GCMC exchanges
(insertions or deletions) and MC moves of gas atoms or molecules.
On those timesteps, the average number of attempted GCMC exchanges is X,
while the average number of attempted MC moves is M.
For GCMC exchanges of either molecular or atomic gasses,
these exchanges can be either deletions or insertions,
with equal probability.

The possible choices for MC moves are translation of an atom,
translation of a molecule, and rotation of a molecule.
The relative amounts of each are determined by the optional
*mcmoves* keyword (see below).
The default behavior is as follows.
If the *mol* keyword is used, only molecule translations
and molecule rotations are performed with equal probability.
Conversely, if the *mol* keyword is not used, only atom
translations are performed.
M should typically be
chosen to be approximately equal to the expected number of gas atoms
or molecules of the given type within the simulation cell or region,
which will result in roughly one MC move per atom or molecule
per MC cycle.

All inserted particles are always added to two groups: the default
group "all" and the fix group specified in the fix command.
In addition, particles are also added to any groups
specified by the *group* and *grouptype* keywords.  If inserted
particles are individual atoms, they are assigned the atom type given
by the type argument.  If they are molecules, the type argument has no
effect and must be set to zero. Instead, the type of each atom in the
inserted molecule is specified in the file read by the
:doc:`molecule <molecule>` command.

.. note::

   Care should be taken to apply fix gcmc only to
   a group that contains only those atoms and molecules
   that you wish to manipulate using Monte Carlo.
   Hence it is generally not a good idea to specify
   the default group "all" in the fix command, although it is allowed.

This fix cannot be used to perform GCMC insertions of gas atoms or
molecules other than the exchanged type, but GCMC deletions,
and MC translations, and rotations can be performed on any atom/molecule in
the fix group.  All atoms in the simulation cell can be moved using
regular time integration translations, e.g. via :doc:`fix nvt <fix_nh>`,
resulting in a hybrid GCMC+MD simulation. A smaller-than-usual
timestep size may be needed when running such a hybrid simulation,
especially if the inserted molecules are not well equilibrated.

This command may optionally use the *region* keyword to define an
exchange and move volume.  The specified region must have been
previously defined with a :doc:`region <region>` command.  It must be
defined with side = *in*\ .  Insertion attempts occur only within the
specified region. For non-rectangular regions, random trial points are
generated within the rectangular bounding box until a point is found
that lies inside the region. If no valid point is generated after 1000
trials, no insertion is performed, but it is counted as an attempted
insertion.  Move and deletion attempt candidates are selected from gas
atoms or molecules within the region. If there are no candidates, no
move or deletion is performed, but it is counted as an attempt move or
deletion. If an attempted move places the atom or molecule
center-of-mass outside the specified region, a new attempted move is
generated. This process is repeated until the atom or molecule
center-of-mass is inside the specified region.

If used with :doc:`fix nvt <fix_nh>`, the temperature of the imaginary
reservoir, T, should be set to be equivalent to the target temperature
used in fix nvt. Otherwise, the imaginary reservoir will not be in
thermal equilibrium with the simulation cell. Also, it is important
that the temperature used by fix nvt be dynamic/dof, which can be
achieved as follows:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute mdtemp mdatoms temp
   compute_modify mdtemp dynamic/dof yes
   fix mdnvt mdatoms nvt temp 300.0 300.0 10.0
   fix_modify mdnvt temp mdtemp

Note that neighbor lists are re-built every timestep that this fix is
invoked, so you should not set N to be too small.  However, periodic
rebuilds are necessary in order to avoid dangerous rebuilds and missed
interactions. Specifically, avoid performing so many MC translations
per timestep that atoms can move beyond the neighbor list skin
distance. See the :doc:`neighbor <neighbor>` command for details.

When an atom or molecule is to be inserted, its coordinates are chosen
at a random position within the current simulation cell or region, and
new atom velocities are randomly chosen from the specified temperature
distribution given by T. The effective temperature for new atom
velocities can be increased or decreased using the optional keyword
*tfac_insert* (see below). Relative coordinates for atoms in a
molecule are taken from the template molecule provided by the
user. The center of mass of the molecule is placed at the insertion
point. The orientation of the molecule is chosen at random by rotating
about this point.

Individual atoms are inserted, unless the *mol* keyword is used.  It
specifies a *template-ID* previously defined using the
:doc:`molecule <molecule>` command, which reads a file that defines the
molecule.  The coordinates, atom types, charges, etc., as well as any
bonding and special neighbor information for the molecule can
be specified in the molecule file.  See the :doc:`molecule <molecule>`
command for details.  The only settings required to be in this file
are the coordinates and types of atoms in the molecule.

When not using the *mol* keyword, you should ensure you do not delete
atoms that are bonded to other atoms, or LAMMPS will soon generate an
error when it tries to find bonded neighbors.  LAMMPS will warn you if
any of the atoms eligible for deletion have a non-zero molecule ID,
but does not check for this at the time of deletion.

If you wish to insert molecules using the *mol* keyword that will be
treated as rigid bodies, use the *rigid* keyword, specifying as its
value the ID of a separate :doc:`fix rigid/small <fix_rigid>` command
which also appears in your input script.

.. note::

   If you wish the new rigid molecules (and other rigid molecules)
   to be thermostatted correctly via :doc:`fix rigid/small/nvt <fix_rigid>`
   or :doc:`fix rigid/small/npt <fix_rigid>`, then you need to use the
   "fix_modify dynamic/dof yes" command for the rigid fix.  This is to
   inform that fix that the molecule count will vary dynamically.

If you wish to insert molecules via the *mol* keyword, that will have
their bonds or angles constrained via SHAKE, use the *shake* keyword,
specifying as its value the ID of a separate :doc:`fix shake <fix_shake>` command which also appears in your input script.

Optionally, users may specify the relative amounts of different MC
moves using the *mcmoves* keyword. The values *Patomtrans*,
*Pmoltrans*, *Pmolrotate* specify the average proportion of
atom translations, molecule translations, and molecule rotations,
respectively. The values must be non-negative integers or real
numbers, with at least one non-zero value. For example, (10,30,0)
would result in 25% of the MC moves being atomic translations, 75%
molecular translations, and no molecular rotations.

Optionally, users may specify the maximum rotation angle for molecular
rotations using the *maxangle* keyword and specifying the angle in
degrees. Rotations are performed by generating a random point on the
unit sphere and a random rotation angle on the range
[0,maxangle). The molecule is then rotated by that angle about an
axis passing through the molecule center of mass. The axis is parallel
to the unit vector defined by the point on the unit sphere.  The same
procedure is used for randomly rotating molecules when they are
inserted, except that the maximum angle is 360 degrees.

Note that fix gcmc does not use configurational bias MC or any other
kind of sampling of intramolecular degrees of freedom.  Inserted
molecules can have different orientations, but they will all have the
same intramolecular configuration, which was specified in the molecule
command input.

For atomic gasses, inserted atoms have the specified atom type, but
deleted atoms are any atoms that have been inserted or that already
belong to the fix group. For molecular gasses, exchanged
molecules use the same atom types as in the template molecule supplied
by the user.  In both cases, exchanged atoms/molecules are assigned to
two groups: the default group "all" and the fix group
(which can also be "all").

The chemical potential is a user-specified input parameter defined
as:

.. math::

   \mu = \mu^{id} + \mu^{ex}

The second term mu_ex is the excess chemical potential due to
energetic interactions and is formally zero for the fictitious gas
reservoir but is non-zero for interacting systems. So, while the
chemical potential of the reservoir and the simulation cell are equal,
mu_ex is not, and as a result, the densities of the two are generally
quite different.  The first term mu_id is the ideal gas contribution
to the chemical potential.  mu_id can be related to the density or
pressure of the fictitious gas reservoir by:

.. math::

   \mu^{id}  = & k T \ln{\rho \Lambda^3} \\
             = & k T \ln{\frac{\phi P \Lambda^3}{k T}}

where *k* is Boltzman's constant, *T* is the user-specified
temperature, :math:`\rho` is the number density, *P* is the pressure,
and :math:`\phi` is the fugacity coefficient.  The constant
:math:`\Lambda` is required for dimensional consistency.  For all unit
styles except *lj* it is defined as the thermal de Broglie wavelength

.. math::

   \Lambda = \sqrt{ \frac{h^2}{2 \pi m k T}}

where *h* is Planck's constant, and *m* is the mass of the exchanged atom
or molecule.  For unit style *lj*, :math:`\Lambda` is simply set to
unity. Note that prior to March 2017, :math:`\Lambda` for unit style *lj*
was calculated using the above formula with *h* set to the rather specific
value of 0.18292026.  Chemical potential under the old definition can
be converted to an equivalent value under the new definition by
subtracting :math:`3 k T \ln(\Lambda_{old})`.

As an alternative to specifying mu directly, the ideal gas reservoir
can be defined by its pressure *P* using the *pressure* keyword, in
which case the user-specified chemical potential is ignored. The user
may also specify the fugacity coefficient :math:`\phi` using the
*fugacity_coeff* keyword, which defaults to unity.

The *full_energy* option means that the fix calculates the total
potential energy of the entire simulated system, instead of just
the energy of the part that is changed. The total system
energy before and after the proposed GCMC exchange or MC move
is then used in the
Metropolis criterion to determine whether or not to accept the
proposed change. By default, this option is off,
in which case only
partial energies are computed to determine the energy difference
due to the proposed change.

The *full_energy* option is needed for systems with complicated
potential energy calculations, including the following:

* long-range electrostatics (kspace)
* many-body pair styles
* hybrid pair styles
* eam pair styles
* tail corrections
* need to include potential energy contributions from other fixes

In these cases, LAMMPS will automatically apply the *full_energy*
keyword and issue a warning message.

When the *mol* keyword is used, the *full_energy* option also includes
the intramolecular energy of inserted and deleted molecules, whereas
this energy is not included when *full_energy* is not used. If this
is not desired, the *intra_energy* keyword can be used to define an
amount of energy that is subtracted from the final energy when a
molecule is inserted, and subtracted from the initial energy when a molecule
is deleted. For molecules that have a non-zero intramolecular energy,
this will ensure roughly the same behavior whether or not the
*full_energy* option is used.

Inserted atoms and molecules are assigned random velocities based on
the specified temperature *T*. Because the relative velocity of all
atoms in the molecule is zero, this may result in inserted molecules
that are systematically too cold. In addition, the intramolecular
potential energy of the inserted molecule may cause the kinetic energy
of the molecule to quickly increase or decrease after insertion.  The
*tfac_insert* keyword allows the user to counteract these effects by
changing the temperature used to assign velocities to inserted atoms
and molecules by a constant factor. For a particular application, some
experimentation may be required to find a value of *tfac_insert* that
results in inserted molecules that equilibrate quickly to the correct
temperature.

Some fixes have an associated potential energy. Examples of such fixes
include: :doc:`efield <fix_efield>`, :doc:`gravity <fix_gravity>`,
:doc:`addforce <fix_addforce>`, :doc:`langevin <fix_langevin>`,
:doc:`restrain <fix_restrain>`,
:doc:`temp/berendsen <fix_temp_berendsen>`,
:doc:`temp/rescale <fix_temp_rescale>`, and :doc:`wall fixes <fix_wall>`.
For that energy to be included in the total potential energy of the
system (the quantity used when performing GCMC exchange and MC moves),
you MUST enable
the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` *energy* option for that fix.  The
doc pages for individual :doc:`fix <fix>` commands specify if this
should be done.

Use the *charge* option to insert atoms with a user-specified point
charge. Note that doing so will cause the system to become
non-neutral.  LAMMPS issues a warning when using long-range
electrostatics (kspace) with non-neutral systems. See the :doc:`compute group/group <compute_group_group>` documentation for more details
about simulating non-neutral systems with kspace on.

Use of this fix typically will cause the number of atoms to fluctuate,
therefore, you will want to use the
:doc:`compute_modify dynamic/dof <compute_modify>` command to insure that the
current number of atoms is used as a normalizing factor each time
temperature is computed. A simple example of this is:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute_modify thermo_temp dynamic yes

A more complicated example is listed earlier on this page
in the context of NVT dynamics.

.. note::

   If the density of the cell is initially very small or zero, and
   increases to a much larger density after a period of equilibration,
   then certain quantities that are only calculated once at the start
   (kspace parameters) may no longer be accurate.  The
   solution is to start a new simulation after the equilibrium density
   has been reached.

With some pair_styles, such as :doc:`Buckingham <pair_buck>`,
:doc:`Born-Mayer-Huggins <pair_born>` and :doc:`ReaxFF <pair_reaxff>`, two
atoms placed close to each other may have an arbitrary large, negative
potential energy due to the functional form of the potential.  While
these unphysical configurations are inaccessible to typical dynamical
trajectories, they can be generated by Monte Carlo moves. The
*overlap_cutoff* keyword suppresses these moves by effectively
assigning an infinite positive energy to all new configurations that
place any pair of atoms closer than the specified overlap cutoff
distance.

The *max* and *min* keywords allow for the restriction of the number
of atoms in the simulation. They automatically reject all insertion
or deletion moves that would take the system beyond the set boundaries.
Should the system already be beyond the boundary, only moves that bring
the system closer to the bounds may be accepted.

The *group* keyword adds all inserted atoms to the
:doc:`group <group>` of the group-ID value. The *grouptype* keyword
adds all inserted atoms of the specified type to the
:doc:`group <group>` of the group-ID value.

Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This fix writes the state of the fix to :doc:`binary restart files
<restart>`.  This includes information about the random number
generator seed, the next timestep for MC exchanges, the number of MC
step attempts and successes etc.  See the :doc:`read_restart
<read_restart>` command for info on how to re-specify a fix in an
input script that reads a restart file, so that the operation of the
fix continues in an uninterrupted fashion.

.. note::

   For this to work correctly, the timestep must **not** be changed
   after reading the restart with :doc:`reset_timestep <reset_timestep>`.
   The fix will try to detect it and stop with an error.

None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options are relevant to
this fix.

This fix computes a global vector of length 8, which can be accessed
by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.  The vector values are
the following global cumulative quantities:

* 1 = translation attempts
* 2 = translation successes
* 3 = insertion attempts
* 4 = insertion successes
* 5 = deletion attempts
* 6 = deletion successes
* 7 = rotation attempts
* 8 = rotation successes

The vector values calculated by this fix are "extensive".

No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.  This fix is not invoked during
:doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix is part of the MC package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS was
built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>`
doc page for more info.

Do not set "neigh_modify once yes" or else this fix will never be
called.  Reneighboring is required.

Can be run in parallel, but aspects of the GCMC part will not scale
well in parallel. Only usable for 3D simulations.

When using fix gcmc in combination with fix shake or fix rigid,
only GCMC exchange moves are supported, so the argument
*M* must be zero.

When using fix gcmc in combination with fix rigid, deletion
of the last remaining molecule is not allowed for technical reasons,
and so the molecule count will never drop below 1, regardless of the
specified chemical potential.

Note that very lengthy simulations involving insertions/deletions of
billions of gas molecules may run out of atom or molecule IDs and
trigger an error, so it is better to run multiple shorter-duration
simulations. Likewise, very large molecules have not been tested and
may turn out to be problematic.

Use of multiple fix gcmc commands in the same input script can be
problematic if using a template molecule. The issue is that the
user-referenced template molecule in the second fix gcmc command may
no longer exist since it might have been deleted by the first fix gcmc
command. An existing template molecule will need to be referenced by
the user for each subsequent fix gcmc command.
