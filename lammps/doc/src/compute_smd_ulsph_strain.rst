Syntax
""""""

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute ID group-ID smd/ulsph/strain

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`compute <compute>` command
* smd/ulsph/strain = style name of this compute command

Examples
""""""""

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   compute 1 all smd/ulsph/strain

Description
"""""""""""

Define a computation that outputs the logarithmic strain tensor.  for
particles interacting via the updated Lagrangian SPH pair style.

See `this PDF guide <PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf>`_ to using Smooth
Mach Dynamics in LAMMPS.

Output info
"""""""""""

This compute calculates a per-particle tensor, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.
See the :doc:`Howto output <Howto_output>` page for an overview of
LAMMPS output options.

The per-particle vector has 6 entries, corresponding to the xx, yy,
zz, xy, xz, yz components of the symmetric strain rate tensor.

The per-particle tensor values will be given dimensionless, see
:doc:`units <units>`.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This compute is part of the MACHDYN package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info. This compute can
only be used for particles which interact with the updated Lagrangian
SPH pair style.
