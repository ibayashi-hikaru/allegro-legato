jump command
============

Syntax

.. parsed-literal::

   jump file label

* file = filename of new input script to switch to
* label = optional label within file to jump to

Examples

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   jump newfile
   jump in.run2 runloop
   jump SELF runloop

Description
"""""""""""

This command closes the current input script file, opens the file with
the specified name, and begins reading LAMMPS commands from that file.
Unlike the :doc:`include <include>` command, the original file is not
returned to, although by using multiple jump commands it is possible
to chain from file to file or back to the original file.

If the word "SELF" is used for the filename, then the current input
script is re-opened and read again.

.. note::

   The SELF option is not guaranteed to work when the current input
   script is being read through stdin (standard input), e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   lmp_g++ < in.script

since the SELF option invokes the C-library rewind() call, which may
not be supported for stdin on some systems or by some MPI
implementations.  This can be worked around by using the :doc:`-in command-line switch <Run_options>`, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   lmp_g++ -in in.script

or by using the :doc:`-var command-line switch <Run_options>` to pass
the script name as a variable to the input script.  In the latter
case, a :doc:`variable <variable>` called "fname" could be used in place
of SELF, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   lmp_g++ -var fname in.script < in.script

The second argument to the jump command is optional.  If specified, it is
treated as a label and the new file is scanned (without executing
commands) until the label is found, and commands are executed from
that point forward.  This can be used to loop over a portion of the
input script, as in this example.  These commands perform 10 runs,
each of 10000 steps, and create 10 dump files named file.1, file.2,
etc.  The :doc:`next <next>` command is used to exit the loop after 10
iterations.  When the "a" variable has been incremented for the tenth
time, it will cause the next jump command to be skipped.

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   variable a loop 10
   label loop
   dump 1 all atom 100 file.$a
   run 10000
   undump 1
   next a
   jump in.lj loop

If the jump *file* argument is a variable, the jump command can be
used to cause different processor partitions to run different input
scripts.  In this example, LAMMPS is run on 40 processors, with 4
partitions of 10 procs each.  An in.file containing the example
variable and jump command will cause each partition to run a different
simulation.

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   mpirun -np 40 lmp_ibm -partition 4x10 -in in.file

   variable f world script.1 script.2 script.3 script.4
   jump $f

Here is an example of a loop which checks every 1000 steps if the
system temperature has reached a certain value, and if so, breaks out
of the loop to finish the run.  Note that any variable could be
checked, so long as it is current on the timestep when the run
completes.  As explained on the :doc:`variable <variable>` doc page,
this can be insured by including the variable in thermodynamic output.

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   variable myTemp equal temp
   label loop
   variable a loop 1000
   run 1000
   if "${myTemp} < 300.0" then "jump SELF break"
   next a
   jump SELF loop
   label break
   print "ALL DONE"

Here is an example of a double loop which uses the if and
:doc:`jump <jump>` commands to break out of the inner loop when a
condition is met, then continues iterating through the outer loop.

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   label       loopa
   variable    a loop 5
     label     loopb
     variable  b loop 5
       print     "A,B = $a,$b"
       run       10000
       if        "$b > 2" then "jump SELF break"
     next      b
     jump      in.script loopb
     label       break
     variable    b delete
   next        a
   jump        SELF loopa

Restrictions
""""""""""""

If you jump to a file and it does not contain the specified label,
LAMMPS will come to the end of the file and exit.
