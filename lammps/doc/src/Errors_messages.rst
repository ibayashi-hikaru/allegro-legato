Error messages
==============

This is an alphabetic list of the ERROR messages LAMMPS prints out and
the reason why.  If the explanation here is not sufficient, the
documentation for the offending command may help.  Error messages also
list the source file and line number where the error was generated.
For example, a message like this:

.. parsed-literal::

   ERROR: Illegal velocity command (velocity.cpp:78)

means that line #78 in the file src/velocity.cpp generated the error.
Looking in the source code may help you figure out what went wrong.

Doc page with :doc:`WARNING messages <Errors_warnings>`

----------

*1-3 bond count is inconsistent*
   An inconsistency was detected when computing the number of 1-3
   neighbors for each atom.  This likely means something is wrong with
   the bond topologies you have defined.

*1-4 bond count is inconsistent*
   An inconsistency was detected when computing the number of 1-4
   neighbors for each atom.  This likely means something is wrong with
   the bond topologies you have defined.

*Accelerator sharing is not currently supported on system*
   Multiple MPI processes cannot share the accelerator on your
   system. For NVIDIA GPUs, see the nvidia-smi command to change this
   setting.

*All angle coeffs are not set*
   All angle coefficients must be set in the data file or by the
   angle_coeff command before running a simulation.

*All atom IDs = 0 but atom_modify id = yes*
   Self-explanatory.

   Self-explanatory.

*All bond coeffs are not set*
   All bond coefficients must be set in the data file or by the
   bond_coeff command before running a simulation.

   dihedral_coeff command before running a simulation.

*All improper coeffs are not set*
   All improper coefficients must be set in the data file or by the
   improper_coeff command before running a simulation.

*All masses are not set*
   For atom styles that define masses for each atom type, all masses must
   be set in the data file or by the mass command before running a
   simulation.  They must also be set before using the velocity
   command.

*All mol IDs should be set for fix gcmc group atoms*
   The molecule flag is on, yet not all molecule ids in the fix group
   have been set to non-zero positive values by the user. This is an
   error since all atoms in the fix gcmc group are eligible for deletion,
   rotation, and translation and therefore must have valid molecule ids.

*All pair coeffs are not set*
   All pair coefficients must be set in the data file or by the
   pair_coeff command before running a simulation.

*All read_dump x,y,z fields must be specified for scaled, triclinic coords*
   For triclinic boxes and scaled coordinates you must specify all 3 of
   the x,y,z fields, else LAMMPS cannot reconstruct the unscaled
   coordinates.

   angle on a particular processor.  The pairwise cutoff is too short or
   the atoms are too far apart to make a valid angle.

*Angle atom missing in set command*
   The set command cannot find one or more atoms in a particular angle on
   a particular processor.  The pairwise cutoff is too short or the atoms
   are too far apart to make a valid angle.

*Angle atoms %d %d %d missing on proc %d at step %ld*
   One or more of 3 atoms needed to compute a particular angle are
   missing on this processor.  Typically this is because the pairwise
   cutoff is set too short or the angle has blown apart and an atom is
   too far away.

*Angle atoms missing on proc %d at step %ld*
   One or more of 3 atoms needed to compute a particular angle are
   missing on this processor.  Typically this is because the pairwise
   cutoff is set too short or the angle has blown apart and an atom is
   too far away.

*Angle coeff for hybrid has invalid style*
   Angle style hybrid uses another angle style as one of its
   coefficients.  The angle style used in the angle_coeff command or read
   from a restart file is not recognized.

*Angle coeffs are not set*
   No angle coefficients have been assigned in the data file or via the
   angle_coeff command.

   Angles read in from the data file were not assigned correctly to
   atoms.  This means there is something invalid about the topology
   definitions.

   The data file header lists angles but no angle types.

*Append boundary must be shrink/minimum*
   The boundary style of the face where atoms are added
   must be of type m (shrink/minimum).

*Atom count is inconsistent, cannot write restart file*
   Sum of atoms across processors does not equal initial total count.
   This is probably because you have lost some atoms.

*Atom in too many rigid bodies - boost MAXBODY*
   Fix poems has a parameter MAXBODY (in fix_poems.cpp) which determines
   the maximum number of rigid bodies a single atom can belong to (i.e. a
   multibody joint).  The bodies you have defined exceed this limit.

*Atom sort did not operate correctly*

*Bond/react: Unknown section in map file*
   Please ensure reaction map files are properly formatted.

*Bond/react: Atom/Bond type affected by reaction too close to template edge*
   This means an atom which changes type or connectivity during the
   reaction is too close to an 'edge' atom defined in the map
   file.  This could cause incorrect assignment of bonds, angle, etc.
   Generally, this means you must include more atoms in your templates,
   such that there are at least two atoms between each atom involved in
   the reaction and an edge atom.

*Bond/react: Fix bond/react needs ghost atoms from farther away*
   This is because a processor needs to map the entire unreacted

   LAMMPS failed to compute an initial guess for the PPPM_disp g_ewald_6
   factor that partitions the computation between real space and k-space
   for Dispersion interactions.

*Cannot create an atom map unless atoms have IDs*
   The simulation requires a mapping from global atom IDs to local atoms,
   but the atoms that have been defined have no IDs.

*Cannot create atoms with undefined lattice*
   Must use the lattice command before using the create_atoms
   command.

*Out of range atoms - cannot compute MSM*
   One or more atoms are attempting to map their charge to a MSM grid point
   that is not owned by a processor.  This is likely for one of two
   reasons, both of them bad.  First, it may mean that an atom near the
   boundary of a processor's sub-domain has moved more than 1/2 the
   :doc:`neighbor skin distance <neighbor>` without neighbor lists being
   rebuilt and atoms being migrated to new processors.  This also means
   you may be missing pairwise interactions that need to be computed.
   The solution is to change the re-neighboring criteria via the
   :doc:`neigh_modify <neigh_modify>` command.  The safest settings are
   "delay 0 every 1 check yes".  Second, it may mean that an atom has
   moved far outside a processor's sub-domain or even the entire
   simulation box. This indicates bad physics, e.g. due to highly
   overlapping atoms, too large a timestep, etc.

*Processors command after simulation box is defined*
   The processors command cannot be used after a read_data, read_restart,
   or create_box command.

*Processors custom grid file is inconsistent*
   The vales in the custom file are not consistent with the number of
   processors you are running on or the Px,Py,Pz settings of the
   processors command.  Or there was not a setting for every processor.

*Processors grid numa and map style are incompatible*
   Using numa for gstyle in the processors command requires using
   cart for the map option.

*Processors part option and grid style are incompatible*
   Cannot use gstyle numa or custom with the part option.

*Processors twogrid requires proc count be a multiple of core count*
   Self-explanatory.

*Pstart and Pstop must have the same value*
   Self-explanatory.

*Python function evaluation failed*
   The Python function did not run successfully and/or did not return a
   value (if it is supposed to return a value).  This is probably due to
   some error condition in the function.

*Python function is not callable*
   The provided Python code was run successfully, but it not
   define a callable function with the required name.

*Python invoke of undefined function*
   Cannot invoke a function that has not been previously defined.

*Read dump of atom property that is not allocated*
   Self-explanatory.

*Read rerun dump file timestep > specified stop*
   Self-explanatory.

*Read restart MPI-IO input not allowed with % in filename*
   This is because a % signifies one file per processor and MPI-IO
   creates one large file for all processors.

*Read_data shrink wrap did not assign all atoms correctly*
   This is typically because the box-size specified in the data file is
   large compared to the actual extent of atoms in a shrink-wrapped
   dimension.  When LAMMPS shrink-wraps the box atoms will be lost if the
   processor they are re-assigned to is too far away.  Choose a box
   size closer to the actual extent of the atoms.

*Read_dump command before simulation box is defined*
   The read_dump command cannot be used before a read_data, read_restart,
   or create_box command.

   does not exist.

*Replacing a fix, but new style != old style*
   A fix ID can be used a second time, but only if the style matches the
   previous fix.  In this case it is assumed you with to reset a fix's
   parameters.  This error may mean you are mistakenly re-using a fix ID
   when you do not intend to.

*Replicate command before simulation box is defined*
   The replicate command cannot be used before a read_data, read_restart,
   or create_box command.

*Replicate did not assign all atoms correctly*
   Atoms replicated by the replicate command were not assigned correctly
   to processors.  This is likely due to some atom coordinates being
   outside a non-periodic simulation box.

*Respa levels must be >= 1*
   Self-explanatory.

*Respa middle cutoffs are invalid*

*Restart file MPI-IO output not allowed with % in filename*
   This is because a % signifies one file per processor and MPI-IO
   creates one large file for all processors.

*Restart file byte ordering is not recognized*
   The file does not appear to be a LAMMPS restart file since it does not
   contain a recognized byte-ordering flag at the beginning.

*Restart file byte ordering is swapped*
   The file was written on a machine with different byte-ordering than
   the machine you are reading it on.  Convert it to a text data file
   instead, on the machine you wrote it on.

*Restart file incompatible with current version*
   This is probably because you are trying to read a file created with a
   version of LAMMPS that is too old compared to the current version.
   Use your older version of LAMMPS and convert the restart file
   to a data file.

*Reuse of dump ID*
   A dump ID cannot be used twice.

*Reuse of molecule template ID*
   The template IDs must be unique.

*Reuse of region ID*
   A region ID cannot be used twice.

*Rigid body atoms %d %d missing on proc %d at step %ld*
   This means that an atom cannot find the atom that owns the rigid body
   it is part of, or vice versa.  The solution is to use the communicate
   cutoff command to insure ghost atoms are acquired from far enough away
   to encompass the max distance printed when the fix rigid/small command
   was invoked.

*Rigid body has degenerate moment of inertia*
   Fix poems will only work with bodies (collections of atoms) that have
   non-zero principal moments of inertia.  This means they must be 3 or
   more non-collinear atoms, even with joint atoms removed.

*Rigid fix must come before NPT/NPH fix*

   command are not all accessible to a processor.  This probably means
   an atom has moved too far.
