fix lb/viscous command
======================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   fix ID group-ID lb/viscous

* ID, group-ID are documented in :doc:`fix <fix>` command
* lb/viscous = style name of this fix command

Examples
""""""""

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   fix 1 flow lb/viscous

Description
"""""""""""

This fix is similar to the :doc:`fix viscous <fix_viscous>` command, and
is to be used in place of that command when a lattice-Boltzmann fluid
is present, and the user wishes to integrate the particle motion using
one of the built in LAMMPS integrators.

This fix adds a force, F = - Gamma\*(velocity-fluid_velocity), to each
atom, where Gamma is the force coupling constant described in the :doc:`fix lb/fluid <fix_lb_fluid>` command (which applies an equal and
opposite force to the fluid).

.. note::

   This fix should only be used in conjunction with one of the
   built in LAMMPS integrators; it should not be used with the :doc:`fix lb/pc <fix_lb_pc>` or :doc:`fix lb/rigid/pc/sphere <fix_lb_rigid_pc_sphere>` integrators, which
   already include the hydrodynamic forces.  These latter fixes should
   only be used if the force coupling constant has been set by the user
   (instead of using the default value); if the default force coupling
   value is used, then this fix provides the only method for adding the
   hydrodynamic forces to the particles.

For further details, as well as descriptions and results of several
test runs, see :ref:`Mackay et al. <Mackay3>`.  Please include a citation to

research.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

As described in the :doc:`fix viscous <fix_viscous>` documentation:

"No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.  None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.

The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization,
invoked by the :doc:`minimize <minimize>` command.  This fix should only
be used with damped dynamics minimizers that allow for
non-conservative forces.  See the :doc:`min_style <min_style>` command
for details."

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix is part of the LATBOLTZ package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info.

Can only be used if a lattice-Boltzmann fluid has been created via the
:doc:`fix lb/fluid <fix_lb_fluid>` command, and must come after this
command.

This fix should not be used if either the :doc:`fix lb/pc <fix_lb_pc>`
or :doc:`fix lb/rigid/pc/sphere <fix_lb_rigid_pc_sphere>` integrator is
used.
