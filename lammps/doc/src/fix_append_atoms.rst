Description
"""""""""""

This fix creates atoms on a lattice, appended on the zhi edge of the
system box.  This can be useful when a shock or wave is propagating
from zlo.  This allows the system to grow with time to accommodate an
expanding wave.  A simulation box must already exist, which is
typically created via the :doc:`create_box <create_box>` command.
Before using this command, a lattice must also be defined using the
:doc:`lattice <lattice>` command.

This fix will automatically freeze atoms on the zhi edge of the
system, so that overlaps are avoided when new atoms are appended.

The *basis* keyword specifies an atom type that will be assigned to
specific basis atoms as they are created.  See the
:doc:`lattice <lattice>` command for specifics on how basis atoms are
defined for the unit cell of the lattice.  By default, all created
atoms are assigned type = 1 unless this keyword specifies differently.

The *size* keyword defines the size in z of the chunk of material to
be added.

The *random* keyword will give the atoms random displacements around
their lattice points to simulate some initial temperature.

The *temp* keyword will cause a region to be thermostatted with a
Langevin thermostat on the zhi boundary.  The size of the region is
measured from zhi and is set with the *extent* argument.

The *units* keyword determines the meaning of the distance units used
to define a wall position, but only when a numeric constant is used.
A *box* value selects standard distance units as defined by the
:doc:`units <units>` command, e.g. Angstroms for units = real or metal.
A *lattice* value means the distance units are in lattice spacings.
The :doc:`lattice <lattice>` command must have been previously used to
define the lattice spacings.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

No information about this fix is written to :doc:`binary restart files <restart>`.  None of the :doc:`fix_modify <fix_modify>` options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various :doc:`output commands <Howto_output>`.
No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of
the :doc:`run <run>` command.  This fix is not invoked during :doc:`energy minimization <minimize>`.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This fix style is part of the SHOCK package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info.

The boundary on which atoms are added with append/atoms must be
shrink/minimum.  The opposite boundary may be any boundary type other
than periodic.

Default
"""""""

The keyword defaults are size = 0.0, freq = 0, units = lattice.  All
added atoms are of type 1 unless the basis keyword is used.
