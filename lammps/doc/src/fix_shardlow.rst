   fix 1 all shardlow

Description
"""""""""""

Specifies that the Shardlow splitting algorithm (SSA) is to be used to
integrate the DPD equations of motion.  The SSA splits the integration
into a stochastic and deterministic integration step.  The fix
*shardlow* performs the stochastic integration step and must be used
in conjunction with a deterministic integrator (e.g. :doc:`fix nve <fix_nve>` or :doc:`fix nph <fix_nh>`).  The stochastic
integration of the dissipative and random forces is performed prior to
the deterministic integration of the conservative force. Further
details regarding the method are provided in :ref:`(Lisal) <Lisal>` and
:ref:`(Larentzos1) <Larentzos1sh>`.

The fix *shardlow* must be used with the :doc:`pair_style dpd/fdt <pair_style>` or :doc:`pair_style dpd/fdt/energy <pair_style>` command to properly initialize the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem parameter(s) sigma (and kappa, if
necessary).

Note that numerous variants of DPD can be specified by choosing an
appropriate combination of the integrator and :doc:`pair_style dpd/fdt <pair_style>` command.  DPD under isothermal conditions can
be specified by using fix *shardlow*, fix *nve* and pair_style
*dpd/fdt*\ .  DPD under isoenergetic conditions can be specified by
using fix *shardlow*, fix *nve* and pair_style *dpd/fdt/energy*\ .  DPD
under isobaric conditions can be specified by using fix shardlow, fix
*nph* and pair_style *dpd/fdt*\ .  DPD under isoenthalpic conditions can
be specified by using fix shardlow, fix *nph* and pair_style
*dpd/fdt/energy*\ .  Examples of each DPD variant are provided in the
examples/PACKAGES/dpd-react directory.

Restrictions
""""""""""""

This command is part of the DPD-REACT package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the :doc:`Build package <Build_package>` page for more info.

This fix is currently limited to orthogonal simulation cell
geometries.

This fix must be used with an additional fix that specifies time
integration, e.g. :doc:`fix nve <fix_nve>` or :doc:`fix nph <fix_nh>`.

The Shardlow splitting algorithm requires the sizes of the sub-domain
lengths to be larger than twice the cutoff+skin.  Generally, the
domain decomposition is dependent on the number of processors
requested.
