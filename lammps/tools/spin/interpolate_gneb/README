Interpolate.x tries to perform a cubic polynomial interpolation
of the MEP.  

Compile the program with:
gcc interpolate.c -o interpolate.x

and then run it as:
./interpolate.x

Enter N-1 (with N the number of replica).
The program reads the "neb_init.dat", in which you need to
replace the current values by your GNEB outputs.

Each line corresponds to a replica, and has to respectively
contain:

Reac. coords /tab/ pot. energy /tab/ fm dot tangent /tab/
geodesic dist to next replica

All those information can be provided by the verbose output of
a neb/spin calculation

The program outputs the interpolation result, and the
interpolated MEP in "interpolation_result.dat".
