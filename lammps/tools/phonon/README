   phana
#
   This program reads the binary file created by fix_phonon and helps to
   analyse the phonon related information.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Dependencies
   The clapack library is needed to solve the eigen problems,
   which could be downloaded from:
   http://www.netlib.org/clapack/
   
   The tricubic library is also needed to do tricubic interpolations,
   which could now be obtained from:
   https://github.com/nbigaouette/libtricubic/
   
   The spglib is optionally needed, enabling one to evaluate the
   phonon density of states or vibrational thermal properties
   using only the irreducible q-points in the first Brillouin zone,
   as well as to evaluate the phonon dispersion curvers with the
   automatic mode. Currently, the 1.8.3 version of spglib is used.
   It can be obtained from:
   http://spglib.sourceforge.net/

   FFTW 3 might also be needed if you would like to interface with
   phonopy: necessary input files for phonopy will be prepared so
   that you can make use of the functions provided by phonopy.
   FFTW 3 can be downloaded from:
   http://www.fftw.org
   
2. Compilation
   To compile the code, one needs therefore to install the above
   libraries and set the paths correctly in the Makefile.
   Once this is done, by typing
     make
   will yield the executable "phana".

3. Unit system
   The units of the output frequencies by this code is THz for
   LAMMPS units "real", "si", "metal", "cgs", "micro", "nano";
   in these cases, the frequencies are $\nu$ instead of $\omega$.
