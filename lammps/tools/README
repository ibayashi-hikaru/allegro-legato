LAMMPS pre- and post-processing tools

This directory contains several stand-alone tools for creating LAMMPS
input files and massaging LAMMPS output data.  Instructions on how to
use the tools are discussed in the "Additional Tools" section of the
LAMMPS documentation.

Tools that are single source files in this directory have additional
comments that may be useful at the top of the source file.  Tools that
reside in their own sub-directories have README files you should look
at.

These are the included tools:

For tools that are single C, C++, or Fortran files, a Makefile for
building them is included in this directory.  You may need to edit it
for the compilers and paths on your system.

For tools in their own sub-directories, see their README file for info
on how to build and use it.
