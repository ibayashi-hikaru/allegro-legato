The directory structure_generators includes several scripts for
generating LAMMPS structure files:

- Be-solid.pl: beryllium solid box
- h2.pl: rectangular lattice of hydrogen atoms
- Diamond.pl: diamond A4 box
- Li-hydride: Lithium hydride solid box
- Li-solid: Lithium solid box (Li-solid-angstromg produces data file in Angstroms)
- Uniform-electron-gas.pl: uniform electron gas on an NaCl lattice

- bohr2ang.py: converts an eFF structure file described in bohr to 
  its corresponding version in Angstroms

And other useful scripts for processing pEFF related information are
included, such as:

- cfg2lammps.py: Python script for converting an eff cfg file into a
  LAMMPS data/script file pair

- lmp2radii.py/pyx: Python/Cython scripts for post-processing a lammps
  trajectory to extract electron radii/frame.

Note: the corresponding .c, and .so files are the c source and binary
library (loadable Python module) created by Cython automatically when
compiling lmp2radii.pyx in place with Cython (python setup.py
build_ext --inplace).

- radii.vmd: a TCL script for adding radial changes per trajectory
  frame to an xyz LAMMPS trajectory of an pEFF run.

- lmp2any.py: Python scipt for extracting quantities from a custom
  lammps dump

- lmp2radii-col.py: Same as lmp2radii.py, but takes a column
  descriptor for the radius

- VMD-input.py: Automatically calls the necessary scripts to produce a
  VMD ready script that loads variable radii into VMD

NOTE: you must set the graphical representation in VMD to represent
electrons using transparency (this requires selecting and applying the
corresponding atom types).
