The asphere_vis tool needs an input script and a dump file
from a LAMMPS run.

In examples/ellipse, you can run LAMMPS with in.ellipse
to generate dump.ellipse

Copy dump.ellipse to this dir.

Run the tool to create a PyMol input file called ellipse.py by typing:

../bin/asphere_vis colors.ellipse dump.ellipse ellipse.py -r 4 -o

Launch PyMol on this input and you should see a viz of
ellipsoids in a box of LJ particles:

pymol ellipse.py
