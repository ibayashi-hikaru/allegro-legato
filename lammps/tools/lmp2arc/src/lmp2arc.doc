   Version 0.1:  8/14/97  MJP   initial version  NVT only
   Version 1.0:  7/27/98  JEC   rewrote to reduce storage and generalize programs
   Version 1.1: 10/22/98  JEC   geometric molecule "unwrapping" algorithm included
   Version 1.2: 11/04/98  JEC   multiple position files in input; data structures
                                standardized with lmp2gxf

   This program converts a LAMMPS dump (position) file to a MSI
   .arc file using a .car file as the template. This enables one to
   visualize a LAMMPS trajectory using Insight II.

    Usage: lmp2arc.exe [options] -car carfile < infile > outfile

      options

	      -trueflags  (default is not present)

	         trueflags are present in the LAMMPS position file.

	      -move_mol   (default is not present)

                 Unwraps molecules. All atoms in the position file are in
                 simulation cell. This means that molecules which
                 are sticking out of the cell will have some of its
                 atoms "wrapped" to the other side of the periodic cell.
                 This leads to very messy visualizations. Specification
                 of -move_mol will attempt to "unwrap" or straighten 
                 molecules and yield a reasonable visualization. However,
                 molecules which oscillate around half in or out of the
                 box may appear to jump from one side of the box to
                 the other. 

                 Two algorithms are used depending upon the presence of
                 trueflags. The algorithm that uses trueflags is the
                 most robust, but the other geometric based algorithm 
                 should be adequate.

	      -car filename

	         the name of the .car file that corresponds to the
		 position information. This is required.

	      -skip n   (default is 0)

	         Skip every n timesteps in the position file.

	      -npico n  (default is 2000)

	         Number of timesteps in 1 picosecond of simulation
                 

	      stdin

	         file containing one or more names of LAMMPS position files

	      stdout

	         the name of the new .arc file

   Examples:

    % lmp2arc.exe -trueflags -move_mol -skip 4 -car water.car <<EOF > water.arc
      water1.pos
      water2.pos
      EOF

>>>> Program output <<<<<
