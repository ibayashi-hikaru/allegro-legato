These classes can either be used to restart a simulation with some different
data or used to start a calculation. Any data given in these classes will
overwrite data given elsewhere.

Classes:
   Initializer: Holds the functions that are required to initialize objects in
      the code. Data can be initialized from a file, or according to a
      particular parameter. An example of the former would be initializing
      the configurations from a xyz file, an example of the latter would be
      initializing the velocities according to the physical temperature.
   InitBase: Simple class that reads data from a string or file.
   InitIndexed: The same as init base, but can also optionally hold
      information about which atom or bead to initialize from.

Functions:
   init_xyz: Reads beads data from a xyz file.
   init_pdb: Reads beads and cell data from a pdb file.
   init_chk: Reads beads, cell and thermostat data from a checkpoint file.
   init_beads: Initializes a beads object from an Initializer object.
   init_vector: Initializes a vector from an Initializer object.
   set_vector: Initializes a vector from another vector.
