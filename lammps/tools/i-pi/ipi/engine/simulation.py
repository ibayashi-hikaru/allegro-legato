The root class for the whole simulation. Contains references to all the top
level objects used in the simulation, and controls all the steps that are
not inherently system dependent, like the running of each time step,
choosing which properties to initialize, and which properties to output.

   Contains all the references and the main dynamics loop. Also handles the

   Attributes:
      beads: A beads object giving the atom positions.
      cell: A cell object giving the system box.
      prng: A random number generator object.
      flist: A list of forcefield objects giving different ways to partially
         calculate the forces.
      forces: A Forces object for calculating the total force for all the
         replicas.
      ensemble: An ensemble object giving the objects necessary for producing
         the correct ensemble.
      tsteps: The total number of steps.
      ttime: The wall clock time (in seconds).
      format: A string specifying both the format and the extension of traj
         output.
      outputs: A list of output objects that should be printed during the run
      nm:  A helper object dealing with normal modes transformation
      properties: A property object for dealing with property output.
      trajs: A trajectory object for dealing with trajectory output.
      chk: A checkpoint object for dealing with checkpoint output.
      rollback: If set to true, the state of the simulation at the start
         of the step will be output to a restart file rather than
         the current state of the simulation. This is because we cannot
         restart from half way through a step, only from the beginning of a
         step, so this is necessary for the trajectory to be continuous.

      step: The current simulation step.
