These are one-file C programs that generate tabulated embedded atom
method (EAM) potentials from analytic formulas.  They each write out a
file in the DYNAMO setfl format which can be input by LAMMPS via the
pair_style eam/alloy command.

The source files and potentials were provided by Gerolf Ziegenhain
(gerolf at ziegenhain.com).  You could modify these programs to write
out your own EAM potentials in LAMMPS-compatible format.
