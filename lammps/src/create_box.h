/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Cannot create_box after simulation box is defined

A simulation box can only be defined once.

E: Cannot run 2d simulation with non-periodic Z dimension

Use the boundary command to make the z dimension periodic in order to
run a 2d simulation.

E: Create_box region ID does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Create_box region does not support a bounding box

Not all regions represent bounded volumes.  You cannot use
such a region with the create_box command.

E: No bonds allowed with this atom style

Self-explanatory.

E: No angles allowed with this atom style

Self-explanatory.

E: No dihedrals allowed with this atom style

Self-explanatory.

E: No impropers allowed with this atom style

Self-explanatory.
