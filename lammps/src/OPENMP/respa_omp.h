/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Respa levels must be >= 1

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot set both respa pair and inner/middle/outer

In the rRESPA integrator, you must compute pairwise potentials either
all together (pair), or in pieces (inner/middle/outer).  You can't do
both.

E: Must set both respa inner and outer

Cannot use just the inner or outer option with respa without using the
other.

E: Cannot set respa middle without inner/outer

In the rRESPA integrator, you must define both a inner and outer
setting in order to use a middle setting.

E: Invalid order of forces within respa levels

For respa, ordering of force computations within respa levels must
obey certain rules.  E.g. bonds cannot be compute less frequently than
angles, pairwise forces cannot be computed less frequently than
kspace, etc.

W: One or more respa levels compute no forces

This is computationally inefficient.

E: Respa inner cutoffs are invalid

The first cutoff must be <= the second cutoff.

E: Respa middle cutoffs are invalid

The first cutoff must be <= the second cutoff.

W: No fixes defined, atoms won't move

If you are not using a fix like nve, nvt, npt then atom velocities and
coordinates will not be updated during timestepping.

W: Fix shake with rRESPA computes invalid pressures

This is a known bug in LAMMPS that has not yet been fixed.  If you use
SHAKE with rRESPA and perform a constant volume simulation (e.g. using
fix npt) this only affects the output pressure, not the dynamics of
the simulation.  If you use SHAKE with rRESPA and perform a constant
pressure simulation (e.g. using fix npt) then you will be
equilibrating to the wrong volume.

E: Pair style does not support rRESPA inner/middle/outer

You are attempting to use rRESPA options with a pair style that
does not support them.
