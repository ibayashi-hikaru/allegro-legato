This package implements the "fix colvars" command, which can be used
in a LAMMPS input script.

The fix allows use of enhanced sampling methods based on a reduced set
of "collective variables", including free-energy estimators based on
thermodynamic forces, non-equilibrium work and probability
distributions.

The package uses the "Colvars" library, whose source code is included
in the LAMMPS source code distribution and must be linked with LAMMPS.
See the lib/colvars/README file and the LAMMPS manual for information
on building LAMMPS with external libraries.  The settings in the
Makefile.lammps file in that directory must be correct for LAMMPS to
build correctly with this package installed.

The files in the COLVARS package folder implement an interface
between LAMMPS and Colvars, originally written by Axel Kohlmeyer
(akohlmey@gmail.com) and maintained by Giacomo Fiorin
(giacomo.fiorin@gmail.com).

More info about the Colvars library can be found at:

A reference manual for the package and library is included with the
LAMMPS doc pages:
doc/PDF/colvars-refman-lammps.pdf
which also includes citations to the articles documenting the various
methods that make use Colvars.

There are also example scripts for using this package in the folder
examples/PACKAGES/colvars, as well as the GitHub page for Colvars.
