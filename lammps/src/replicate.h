/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Replicate command before simulation box is defined

The replicate command cannot be used before a read_data, read_restart,
or create_box command.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Cannot replicate 2d simulation in z dimension

The replicate command cannot replicate a 2d simulation in the z
dimension.

W: Replicating in a non-periodic dimension

The parameters for a replicate command will cause a non-periodic
dimension to be replicated; this may cause unwanted behavior.

E: Cannot replicate with fixes that store atom quantities

Either fixes are defined that create and store atom-based vectors or a
restart file was read which included atom-based vectors for fixes.
The replicate command cannot duplicate that information for new atoms.
You should use the replicate command before fixes are applied to the
system.

E: Replicated system atom IDs are too big

See the setting for tagint in the src/lmptype.h file.

E: Replicated system is too big

See the setting for bigint in the src/lmptype.h file.

E: Replicate did not assign all atoms correctly

Atoms replicated by the replicate command were not assigned correctly
to processors.  This is likely due to some atom coordinates being
outside a non-periodic simulation box.
