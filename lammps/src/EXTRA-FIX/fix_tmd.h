/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Cannot use fix TMD unless atom map exists

Using this fix requires the ability to lookup an atom index, which is
provided by an atom map.  An atom map does not exist (by default) for
non-molecular problems.  Using the atom_modify map command will force
an atom map to be created.

E: Cannot open fix tmd file %s

The output file for the fix tmd command cannot be opened.  Check that
the path and name are correct.

E: Cannot use fix TMD on massless group

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Fix tmd must come after integration fixes

Any fix tmd command must appear in the input script after all time
integration fixes (nve, nvt, npt).  See the fix tmd documentation for
details.

E: Incorrect format in TMD target file

Format of file read by fix tmd command is incorrect.

W: Ignoring empty or incorrectly formatted line in target file

UNDOCUMENTED

E: TMD target file did not list all group atoms

The target file for the fix tmd command did not list all atoms in the
fix group.

E: Cannot open gzipped file

LAMMPS was compiled without support for reading and writing gzipped
files through a pipeline to the gzip program with -DLAMMPS_GZIP.

E: Cannot open file %s

The specified file cannot be opened.  Check that the path and name are
correct. If the file is a compressed file, also check that the gzip
executable can be found and run.
