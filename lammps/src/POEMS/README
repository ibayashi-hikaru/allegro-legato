This package implements the fix poems command for coupling multiple
rigid bodies together.

This package uses an external library in lib/poems which must be
compiled before making LAMMPS.  See the lib/poems/README file and the
LAMMPS manual for information on building LAMMPS with external
libraries.  The settings in the Makefile.lammps file in that directory
must be correct for LAMMPS to build correctly with this package
installed.

The people who created the POEMS library and this fix are Rudranarayan
Mukherjee (while at RPI, now at NASA) and Kurt Anderson (RPI).
