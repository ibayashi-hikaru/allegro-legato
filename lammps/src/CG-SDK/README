This package implements 4 commands which can be used in a LAMMPS input
script:

pair_style lj/sdk
pair_style lj/sdk/coul/long
pair_style lj/sdk/coul/msm
angle_style sdk

These styles allow coarse grained MD simulations with the
parametrization of Shinoda, DeVane, Klein, Mol Sim, 33, 27 (2007)
(SDK), with extensions to simulate ionic liquids, electrolytes,
lipids and charged amino acids.

See the doc pages for these commands for details.

There are example scripts for using this package in
examples/PACKAGES/cgsdk

This is the second generation implementation reducing the the clutter
of the previous version. For many systems with long range
electrostatics, it will be faster to use pair_style hybrid/overlay
with lj/sdk and coul/long instead of the combined lj/sdk/coul/long
style, since the number of charged atom types is usually small.
To exploit this property, the use of the kspace_style pppm/cg is
recommended over regular pppm.
