This package implements the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method
under isothermal, isoenergetic, isobaric and isenthalpic conditions.
The DPD equations of motion are integrated efficiently through the
Shardlow splitting algorithm.

Currently, the package has the following features:

* A new DPD atom style for tracking the DPD particle internal energies
  and internal temperature

* Compute commands for accessing the DPD particle internal energies
  and internal temperature

* "fix eos" commands for relating the DPD internal energy to the DPD
  internal temperature through a coarse-grained particle
  equation-of-state

* "fix shardlow" command for integrating the stochastic ODEs

* Pair styles for modeling a DPD fluid

* Commands for setting the particle internal temperature

See the doc pages for "atom style dpd", "compute dpd" and "compute
dpd/atom", "fix eos/cv" and "fix eos/table", "fix shardlow", "pair
dpd/conservative" and "pair dpd/fdt" and "pair dpd/fdt/energy"
commands to get started.  At the bottom of the doc page are many links
to additional documentation contained in the doc/USER/dpd directory.

There are example scripts for using this package in examples/PACKAGES/dpd-react.
