/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Region ID for compute reduce/region does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce replace requires min or max mode

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid replace values in compute reduce

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute ID for compute reduce does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce compute does not calculate a per-atom vector

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce compute does not calculate a per-atom array

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce compute array is accessed out-of-range

An index for the array is out of bounds.

E: Compute reduce compute does not calculate a local vector

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce compute does not calculate a local array

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce compute calculates global values

A compute that calculates peratom or local values is required.

E: Fix ID for compute reduce does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce fix does not calculate a per-atom vector

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce fix does not calculate a per-atom array

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce fix array is accessed out-of-range

An index for the array is out of bounds.

E: Compute reduce fix does not calculate a local vector

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce fix does not calculate a local array

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce fix calculates global values

A fix that calculates peratom or local values is required.

E: Variable name for compute reduce does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Compute reduce variable is not atom-style variable

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix used in compute reduce not computed at compatible time

Fixes generate their values on specific timesteps.  Compute reduce is
requesting a value on a non-allowed timestep.
