/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Could not initialize embedded Python

The main module in Python was not accessible.

E: Invalid python command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Python invoke of undefined function

Cannot invoke a function that has not been previously defined.

E: Python variable does not match Python function

This matching is defined by the python-style variable and the python
command.

E: Could not process Python source command

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Could not open Python file

The specified file of Python code cannot be opened.  Check that the
path and name are correct.

E: Could not process Python file

The Python code in the specified file was not run successfully by
Python, probably due to errors in the Python code.

E: Could not process Python string

The Python code in the here string was not run successfully by Python,
probably due to errors in the Python code.

E: Could not find Python function

The provided Python code was run successfully, but it not
define a callable function with the required name.

E: Python function is not callable

The provided Python code was run successfully, but it not
define a callable function with the required name.

E: Could not create Python function arguments

This is an internal Python error, possibly because the number
of inputs to the function is too large.

E: Could not evaluate Python function input variable

Self-explanatory.

E: Unsupported variable type

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Python function evaluation failed

The Python function did not run successfully and/or did not return a
value (if it is supposed to return a value).  This is probably due to
some error condition in the function.

E: Python command length keyword cannot be used unless output is a string

UNDOCUMENTED

U: Cannot embed Python when also extending Python with LAMMPS

When running LAMMPS via Python through the LAMMPS library interface
you cannot also user the input script python command.
