This package implements smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) in
LAMMPS.  Currently, the package has the following features:

* Tait, ideal gas, Lennard-Jones equation of states, full support for
  complete (i.e. internal-energy dependent) equations of state
* plain or Monaghans XSPH integration of the equations of motion
* density continuity or density summation to propagate the density field
* commands to set internal energy and density of particles from the
  input script
* output commands to access internal energy and density for dumping and
  thermo output

See the file doc/USER/sph/SPH_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to get started.

There are example scripts for using this package in examples/PACKAGES/sph.

The person who created this package is Georg Ganzenmuller at the
Fraunhofer-Institute for High-Speed Dynamics, Ernst Mach Institute in
Germany (georg.ganzenmueller at emi.fhg.de).  Contact him directly if
you have questions.
