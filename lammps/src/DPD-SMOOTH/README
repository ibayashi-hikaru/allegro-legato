This package implements the Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics (SDPD)
method for modelling fluids at mesoscale and diffusion of colloids.
Currently it adds pair style sdpd/taitwater/isothermal for modelling water
at isothermal conditions using the Tait equation of state.
It also adds fix meso/move command to move mesoscopic SPH/SDPD particles with
prescribed velocity and fix rigid/meso command to integrate rigid bodies
composed of mesoscopic SPH/SDPD particles.
