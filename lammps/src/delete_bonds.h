/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Delete_bonds command before simulation box is defined

The delete_bonds command cannot be used before a read_data,
read_restart, or create_box command.

E: Delete_bonds command with no atoms existing

No atoms are yet defined so the delete_bonds command cannot be used.

E: Cannot use delete_bonds with non-molecular system

Your choice of atom style does not have bonds.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Cannot find delete_bonds group ID

Group ID used in the delete_bonds command does not exist.

E: Bond atom missing in delete_bonds

The delete_bonds command cannot find one or more atoms in a particular
bond on a particular processor.  The pairwise cutoff is too short or
the atoms are too far apart to make a valid bond.

E: Angle atom missing in delete_bonds

The delete_bonds command cannot find one or more atoms in a particular
angle on a particular processor.  The pairwise cutoff is too short or
the atoms are too far apart to make a valid angle.

E: Dihedral atom missing in delete_bonds

The delete_bonds command cannot find one or more atoms in a particular
dihedral on a particular processor.  The pairwise cutoff is too short
or the atoms are too far apart to make a valid dihedral.

E: Improper atom missing in delete_bonds

The delete_bonds command cannot find one or more atoms in a particular
improper on a particular processor.  The pairwise cutoff is too short
or the atoms are too far apart to make a valid improper.
