/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: NEBSpin command before simulation box is defined

Self-explanatory.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Cannot use NEBSpin with a single replica

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot use NEBSpin unless atom map exists

Use the atom_modify command to create an atom map.

E: NEBSpin requires use of fix neb

Self-explanatory.

E: NEBSpin requires damped dynamics minimizer

Use a different minimization style.

E: Too many timesteps for NEBSpin

You must use a number of timesteps that fit in a 32-bit integer
for NEBSpin.

E: Too many timesteps

The cumulative timesteps must fit in a 64-bit integer.

E: Unexpected end of neb/spin file

A read operation from the file failed.

E: Incorrect atom format in neb/spin file

The number of fields per line is not what expected.

E: Invalid atom IDs in neb/spin file

An ID in the file was not found in the system.

E: Cannot open gzipped file

LAMMPS was compiled without support for reading and writing gzipped
files through a pipeline to the gzip program with -DLAMMPS_GZIP.

E: Cannot open file %s

The specified file cannot be opened.  Check that the path and name are
correct. If the file is a compressed file, also check that the gzip
executable can be found and run.

U: Can only use NEBSpin with 1-processor replicas

This is current restriction for NEBSpin as implemented in LAMMPS.

U: Cannot use NEBSpin with atom_modify sort enabled

This is current restriction for NEBSpin implemented in LAMMPS.
