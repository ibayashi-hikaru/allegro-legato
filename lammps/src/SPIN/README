The SPIN package enables coupled spin dynamics and molecular
dynamics simulations.

The package provides the following features:

* defining a classical magnetic atomic spin associated to each magnetic
atom in the system
* integrating the equations of motion for the coupled spin-lattice system
* implementing magnetic pair interactions and magnetic forces
* thermostating and applying a transverse damping to the magnetic spins
* performing geodesic NEB calculations
* computing and outputting magnetic quantities
* minimizing the energy or total torque of a magnetic system

The different options provided by this package are explained in the
LAMMPS documentation.

Once you have successfully built LAMMPS with this package, you can test
it using one of the input files provided from the examples/SPIN dir.
For example:

./lmp_serial < lammps/examples/SPIN/cobalt_hcp/in.spin.cobalt_hcp
