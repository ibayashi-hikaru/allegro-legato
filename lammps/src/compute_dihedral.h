/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Dihedral style for compute dihedral command is not hybrid

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Dihedral style for compute dihedral command has changed

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Energy was not tallied on needed timestep

You are using a thermo keyword that requires potentials to
have tallied energy, but they didn't on this timestep.  See the
variable doc page for ideas on how to make this work.

U: Compute bond must use group all

Bond styles accumulate energy on all atoms.

U: Unrecognized bond style in compute bond command

Self-explanatory.
