/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Unrecognized dump style

The choice of dump style is unknown.

W: Calling write_dump before a full system init.

The write_dump command is used before the system has been fully
initialized as part of a 'run' or 'minimize' command. Not all dump
styles and features are fully supported at this point and thus the
command may fail or produce incomplete or incorrect output. Insert
a "run 0" command, if a full system init is required.
