This package provides a plugin command that can load LAMMPS
styles linked into shared object files into a LAMMPS binary
at run time without having to recompile and relink LAMMPS.
For more details please see the LAMMPS manual.

To be able to dynamically load and execute the plugins from inside
LAMMPS, you need to link with an appropriate system library, which
is done using the settings in lib/plugin/Makefile.lammps.  See
that file and the lib/plugin/README file for more details.

The person who created this package is Axel Kohlmeyer at Temple U
(akohlmey at gmail.com).  Contact him directly if you have questions.
