This package implements three extensions of the dissipative particle
dynamics (DPD) method, i.e., energy-conserving DPD (eDPD) that can
model non-isothermal processes, many-body DPD (mDPD) for simulating
vapor-liquid coexistence, and transport DPD (tDPD) for modeling
advection-diffuion-reaction systems. The equations of motion of these
DPD extensions are integrated through the modified velocity-Verlet
(MVV) algorithm.

Currently, the package has the following features:

* Three new atom styles (eDPD, mDPD, tDPD) for tracking the particles
  with internal temperature, local mass density, and chemical
  concentration.

* Three set commands (edpd/temp, edpd/cv, cc) for setting internal
  temperature (edpd/temp) and heat capacity (edpd/cv) for eDPD
  particles and for setting chemical concentration (cc) for tDPD
  particles.

* Two compute commands (edpd/temp/atom, tdpd/cc/atom) for accessing
  the internal temperature of eDPD particles and the chemical
  concentration of tDPD particles.

* Three fix commands (mvv/dpd, mvv/edpd, mvv/tdpd) for integrating the
  shochastic ODEs using the modified velocity-Verlet (MVV) algorithm.

* Two fix commands (edpd/source, tdpd/source) for adding additional
  heat source/sink or chemical concentration source/sink to eDPD and
  tDPD particles.

* One pair style (edpd) for modeling a eDPD fluid.

* Two pair styles (mdpd/rhosum, mdpd) for modeling a mDPD fluid.

* One pair style (tdpd) for modeling a tDPD fluid.
