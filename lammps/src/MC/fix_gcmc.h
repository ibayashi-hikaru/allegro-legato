/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Fix gcmc does not (yet) work with atom_style template

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix gcmc region does not support a bounding box

Not all regions represent bounded volumes.  You cannot use
such a region with the fix gcmc command.

E: Fix gcmc region cannot be dynamic

Only static regions can be used with fix gcmc.

E: Fix gcmc region extends outside simulation box

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix gcmc molecule must have coordinates

The defined molecule does not specify coordinates.

E: Fix gcmc molecule must have atom types

The defined molecule does not specify atom types.

E: Atom type must be zero in fix gcmc mol command

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix gcmc molecule has charges, but atom style does not

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix gcmc molecule template ID must be same as atom_style template ID

When using atom_style template, you cannot insert molecules that are
not in that template.

E: Fix gcmc atom has charge, but atom style does not

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot use fix gcmc rigid and not molecule

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Cannot use fix gcmc shake and not molecule

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot use fix gcmc rigid and shake

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Cannot use fix gcmc rigid with MC moves

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Cannot use fix gcmc shake with MC moves

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Molecule template ID for fix gcmc does not exist

Self-explanatory.

W: Molecule template for fix gcmc has multiple molecules

The fix gcmc command will only create molecules of a single type,
i.e. the first molecule in the template.

E: Region ID for fix gcmc does not exist

Self-explanatory.

W: Fix gcmc using full_energy option

Fix gcmc has automatically turned on the full_energy option since it
is required for systems like the one specified by the user. User input
included one or more of the following: kspace, a hybrid
pair style, an eam pair style, tail correction,
or no "single" function for the pair style.

E: Invalid atom type in fix gcmc command

The atom type specified in the gcmc command does not exist.

E: Fix gcmc cannot exchange individual atoms belonging to a molecule

This is an error since you should not delete only one atom of a
molecule.  The user has specified atomic (non-molecular) gas
exchanges, but an atom belonging to a molecule could be deleted.

E: All mol IDs should be set for fix gcmc group atoms

The molecule flag is on, yet not all molecule ids in the fix group
have been set to non-zero positive values by the user. This is an
error since all atoms in the fix gcmc group are eligible for deletion,
rotation, and translation and therefore must have valid molecule ids.

E: Fix gcmc molecule command requires that atoms have molecule attributes

Should not choose the gcmc molecule feature if no molecules are being
simulated. The general molecule flag is off, but gcmc's molecule flag
is on.

E: Fix gcmc rigid fix does not exist

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Fix gcmc and fix rigid/small not using same molecule template ID

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Fix gcmc shake fix does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix gcmc and fix shake not using same molecule template ID

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot use fix gcmc in a 2d simulation

Fix gcmc is set up to run in 3d only. No 2d simulations with fix gcmc
are allowed.

E: Could not find fix gcmc exclusion group ID

Self-explanatory.

E: Could not find fix gcmc rotation group ID

Self-explanatory.

E: Illegal fix gcmc gas mass <= 0

The computed mass of the designated gas molecule or atom type was less
than or equal to zero.

E: Cannot do GCMC on atoms in atom_modify first group

This is a restriction due to the way atoms are organized in a list to
enable the atom_modify first command.

W: Fix gcmc is being applied to the default group all

This is allowed, but it will result in Monte Carlo moves
being performed on all the atoms in the system, which is
often not what is intended.

E: Could not find specified fix gcmc group ID

Self-explanatory.

E: fix gcmc does currently not support full_energy option with molecules on more than 1 MPI process.

UNDOCUMENTED

W: Energy of old configuration in fix gcmc is > MAXENERGYTEST.

This probably means that a pair of atoms are closer than the
overlap cutoff distance for keyword overlap_cutoff.

E: Fix gcmc put atom outside box

This should not normally happen.  Contact the developers.

E: Fix gcmc ran out of available molecule IDs

See the setting for tagint in the src/lmptype.h file.

E: Fix gcmc ran out of available atom IDs

See the setting for tagint in the src/lmptype.h file.

E: Too many total atoms

See the setting for bigint in the src/lmptype.h file.

U: Fix gcmc can not currently be used with fix rigid or fix rigid/small

Self-explanatory.
