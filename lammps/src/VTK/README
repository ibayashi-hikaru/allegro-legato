This package implements the "dump vtk" command which can be used in a
LAMMPS input script.

This dump allows output of atom data similar to the dump custom
command, but in VTK format.

This package uses the VTK library (www.vtk.org) which must be
installed on your system. See the lib/vtk/README file and the LAMMPS
manual for information on building LAMMPS with external libraries.
The settings in the Makefile.lammps file in that directory must be
correct for LAMMPS to build correctly with this package installed.

This code was initially developed for LIGGGHTS by Daniel Queteschiner
at DCS Computing. This is an effort to integrate it back to LAMMPS.

The person who created this package is Richard Berger at JKU
(richard.berger@jku.at). Contact him directly if you have questions.
