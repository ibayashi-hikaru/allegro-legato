/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Must have more than one processor partition to temper

Cannot use the temper command with only one processor partition.  Use
the -partition command-line option.

E: Temper command before simulation box is defined

The temper command cannot be used before a read_data, read_restart, or
create_box command.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Tempering fix ID is not defined

The fix ID specified by the temper command does not exist.

E: Illegal temperature index

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Invalid frequency in temper command

Nevery must be > 0.

E: Non integer # of swaps in temper command

Swap frequency in temper command must evenly divide the total # of
timesteps.

E: Tempering temperature fix is not supported

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Too many timesteps

The cumulative timesteps must fit in a 64-bit integer.

E: Tempering could not find thermo_pe compute

This compute is created by the thermo command.  It must have been
explicitly deleted by a uncompute command.

U: Tempering temperature fix is not valid

The fix specified by the temper command is not one that controls
temperature (nvt or langevin).
