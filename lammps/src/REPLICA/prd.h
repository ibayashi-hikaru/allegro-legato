/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: PRD command before simulation box is defined

The prd command cannot be used before a read_data,
read_restart, or create_box command.

E: Cannot use PRD with multi-processor replicas unless atom map exists

Use the atom_modify command to create an atom map.

W: Running PRD with only one replica

This is allowed, but you will get no parallel speed-up.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Invalid t_event in prd command

Self-explanatory.

E: PRD nsteps must be multiple of t_event

Self-explanatory.

E: PRD t_corr must be multiple of t_event

Self-explanatory.

E: Could not find compute ID for PRD

Self-explanatory.

W: Resetting reneighboring criteria during PRD

A PRD simulation requires that neigh_modify settings be delay = 0,
every = 1, check = yes.  Since these settings were not in place,
LAMMPS changed them and will restore them to their original values
after the PRD simulation.

E: Too many timesteps

The cumulative timesteps must fit in a 64-bit integer.

E: Cannot use PRD with a changing box

The current box dimensions are not copied between replicas

E: Cannot use PRD with a time-dependent fix defined

PRD alters the timestep in ways that will mess up these fixes.

E: Cannot use PRD with a time-dependent region defined

PRD alters the timestep in ways that will mess up these regions.

E: Too many iterations

You must use a number of iterations that fit in a 32-bit integer
for minimization.

U: Cannot use PRD with atom_modify sort enabled

This is a current restriction of PRD.  You must turn off sorting,
which is enabled by default, via the atom_modify command.
