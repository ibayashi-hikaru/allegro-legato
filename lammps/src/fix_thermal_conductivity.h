/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Fix thermal/conductivity swap value must be positive

Self-explanatory.

W: Fix thermal/conductivity comes before fix ave/spatial

The order of these 2 fixes in your input script is such that fix
thermal/conductivity comes first.  If you are using fix ave/spatial to
measure the temperature profile induced by fix viscosity, then this
may cause a glitch in the profile since you are averaging immediately
after swaps have occurred.  Flipping the order of the 2 fixes
typically helps.
