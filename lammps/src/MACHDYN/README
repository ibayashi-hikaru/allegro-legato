Smooth Mach Dynamics -- Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics for solids and fluids

Currently, the package has the following features:

Does liquids via traditional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)

Also solves solids mechanics problems via a state of the art
stabilized meshless method with hourglass control.

Can specify hydrostatic interactions independently from material
strength models, i.e. pressure and deviatoric stresses are separated.

Many material models available (Johnson-Cook, plasticity with
hardening, Mie-Grueneisen, Polynomial EOS). Easy to add new material
models.

Rigid boundary conditions (walls) can be loaded as surface geometries
from *.STL files.

See the file doc/PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to get started.

There are example scripts for using this package in examples/PACKAGES/machdyn.
The person who created this package is Georg Ganzenmuller at the
Fraunhofer-Institute for High-Speed Dynamics, Ernst Mach Institute in
Germany (georg.ganzenmueller at emi.fhg.de).  Contact him directly if
you have questions.
