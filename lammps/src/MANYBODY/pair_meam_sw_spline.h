 * Our Preamble Notice
 * A. This notice is required to be provided under our contract with the
 * U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This work was produced at the
 * Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract No.
 * DE-AC52-07NA27344 with the DOE.
 *
 * B. Neither the United States Government nor Lawrence Livermore National
 * Security, LLC nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, express or
 * implied, or assumes any liability or responsibility for the accuracy,
 * completeness, or usefulness of any information, apparatus, product, or
 * process disclosed, or represents that its use would not infringe

 *
 * The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
 * follows.
 *
 * GNU Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Modification
 *
 * 0.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
 * notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
 * the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program," below, refers to
 * any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either
 * the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a
 * work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
 * modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter,
 * translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 * Each licensee is addressed as "you."
 *
 * Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 * covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running
 * the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
 * only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of
 * having been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on
 * what the Program does.
 *
 * 1.  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
 * code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 * appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
 * disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
 * License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
 * of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
 *
 * You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
 * may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 *
 * 2.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
 * thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
 * modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
 * also meet all of these conditions:
 *
 *  a)  You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
 *  that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 *
 *  b)  You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
 *  or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to
 *  be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms
 *  of this License.
 *
 *  c)  If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
 *  run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
 *  the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
 *  appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
 *  else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
 *  the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
 *  copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
 *  but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
 *  Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 *
 * These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 * identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
 * can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 * themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 * sections when you distribute them as separate work.  But when you
 * distribute the same section as part of a whole which is a work based on
 * the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
 * License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
 * whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 *
 * Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 * your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 * exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 * collective works based on the Program.
 *
 * In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
 * with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
 * storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
 * scope of this License.
 *
 * 3.  You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
 * Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
 * 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 *
 *  a)  Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
 *  code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
 *  on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 *
 *  b)  Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
 *  to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
 *  physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
 *  copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms
 *  of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
 *  interchange; or,
 *
 *  c)  Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
 *  distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
 *  for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
 *  object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
 *  Subsection b above.)
 *
 * The source code for a work means the preferred form the work for making
 * modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means
 * all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 * interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 * and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the
 * source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
 * distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
 * (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
 * executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
 *
 * If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
 * copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 * source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
 * even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
 * the object code.
 *
 * 4.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
 * as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy,
 * modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
 * automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties
 * who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
 * have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
 * compliance.
 *
 * 5.  You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
 * it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
 * the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law
 * if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing
 * the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
 * acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
 * copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
 *
 * 6.  Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 * Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
 * licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
 * and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
 * recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible
 * for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
 *
 * 7.  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
 * issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
 * order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions
 * of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions
 * of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
 * simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
 * obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at
 * all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
 * redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or
 * indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
 * this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 *
 * If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 * particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply
 * and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 *
 * It is not the purpose to this section to induce you to infringe any patents
 * or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
 * this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
 * software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
 * practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range
 * of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
 * application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
 * she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
 * licensee cannot impose that choice.
 *
 * This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
 * consequence of the rest of this License.
 *
 * 8.  If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
 * countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
 * copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
 * explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
 * that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 * excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 * written in the body of this License.
 *
 * 9.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 * the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
 * similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 * address new problems or concerns.
 *
 * Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
 * specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
 * later version," you have the option of following the terms and conditions
 * either of that version of any later version published by the Free Software
 * Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this
 * License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
 * Foundation.
 *
 * 10.  If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 * programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
 * to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
 * Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
 * make exceptions for this.  Our decision to grant permission will be guided
 * by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
 * free software and or promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 *
 * NO WARRANTY
 *
 * 11.  BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 * FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
 * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 * PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
 * OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
 * TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
 * PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
 * REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 *
 * 12.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 * WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
 * REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 * INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 * OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 * TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
 * YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 * PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 * POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 *
 * END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
