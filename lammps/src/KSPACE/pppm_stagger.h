/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Cannot (yet) use kspace_style pppm/stagger with triclinic systems

This feature is not yet supported.

E: Non-numeric box dimensions - simulation unstable

The box size has apparently blown up.

E: Out of range atoms - cannot compute PPPM

One or more atoms are attempting to map their charge to a PPPM grid
point that is not owned by a processor.  This is likely for one of two
reasons, both of them bad.  First, it may mean that an atom near the
boundary of a processor's sub-domain has moved more than 1/2 the
"neighbor skin distance"_neighbor.html without neighbor lists being
rebuilt and atoms being migrated to new processors.  This also means
you may be missing pairwise interactions that need to be computed.
The solution is to change the re-neighboring criteria via the
"neigh_modify"_neigh_modify command.  The safest settings are "delay 0
every 1 check yes".  Second, it may mean that an atom has moved far
outside a processor's sub-domain or even the entire simulation box.
This indicates bad physics, e.g. due to highly overlapping atoms, too
large a timestep, etc.
