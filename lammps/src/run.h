/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Run command before simulation box is defined

The run command cannot be used before a read_data, read_restart, or
create_box command.

E: Invalid run command N value

The number of timesteps must fit in a 32-bit integer.  If you want to
run for more steps than this, perform multiple shorter runs.

E: Invalid run command upto value

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid run command start/stop value

Self-explanatory.

E: Run command start value is after start of run

Self-explanatory.

E: Run command stop value is before end of run

Self-explanatory.

E: Run flag 'pre no' not compatible with r-RESPA

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Too many timesteps

The cumulative timesteps must fit in a 64-bit integer.
