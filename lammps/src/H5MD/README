This package provides the h5md dump style.

See the doc page for the dump h5md command. This dump style requires
building the bundled ch5md library in lib/h5md, and having HDF5 itself
installed on your system (see lib/h5md/README).

The person who created this package is Pierre de Buyl (KU Leuven); see
http://pdebuyl.be for contact information. Please contact him directly
if you have questions.
