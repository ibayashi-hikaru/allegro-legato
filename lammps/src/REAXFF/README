This package contains a implementation for LAMMPS of the ReaxFF force
field.  ReaxFF uses distance-dependent bond-order functions to
represent the contributions of chemical bonding to the potential
energy.  It was originally developed by Adri van Duin and the Goddard
group at CalTech.

For technical details about this implementation of ReaxFF, see
this paper:

Parallel and Scalable Reactive Molecular Dynamics: Numerical Methods
and Algorithmic Techniques, H. M. Aktulga, J. C. Fogarty,
S. A. Pandit, A. Y. Grama, Parallel Computing, in press (2011).

See the doc page for the pair_style reaxff command for details
of how to use it in LAMMPS.

The person who created this package is Hasan Metin Aktulga (hmaktulga
at lbl.gov), while at Purdue University.  Contact him directly, or
Aidan Thompson at Sandia (athomps at sandia.gov), if you have
questions.

Thanks to Steve Plimpton and Aidan Thompson for their input on the
LAMMPS architecture and for their help in understanding and
customizing some of the required LAMMPS interfaces.
